While they seem close now, that wasn’t always the case, according to Jamie Lynn’s upcoming memoir, Things I Should Have Said. In the book, which hits shelves on January 18, 2022, Jamie Lynn accused her father of trying to “force” her to “abort” her eldest daughter, Maddie Briann Aldridge, when she was pregnant with her at 16 years old. Jamie Lynn shares Maddie, now 13, with her ex-boyfriend, Casey Aldridge. In one chapter, Jamie Lynn recalled the moment her management learned about her pregnancy, which came amid her older sister Britney Spears’ “PR difficulties.” “Once Momma and Daddy told my team, things spiraled out of control pretty quickly. When I walked in, Daddy, Bryan, and Momma were in the house and [a member of] my financial management team was on the phone,” she wrote, according to an excerpt from People. “There was a whole lot of fighting going on between everyone involved. The entire Spears team was already caught up in my sister’s PR difficulties, and everyone around me just wanted to make this ‘issue’ disappear. My family and management pulled me out of school until they could figure out what to do next. They took my smartphone away, fearing the news would get out, and insisted that no one share any information with anyone, especially the press. My daddy and I stopped speaking and the tension was terrible.” Image: Worthy Books. Jamie Lynn went on to reveal that her team, including her family, encouraged her to take “pills” to abort her baby for the sake of her “career.” “One person after another—and there were many—came to my room trying to convince me that having a baby at this point in my life was a terrible idea. There was lots of chatter, but none of it felt right to me,” she wrote. “It will kill your career. You are just too young. You don’t know what you’re doing. There are pills you can take. We can help you take care of this problem. Think about what you’re doing to your family. Doesn’t the family have enough to deal with? I know a doctor. There are procedures that remedy mistakes like this. You don’t have to do this.” She also recalled the moment that she realized that she wanted to keep her baby, despite her team’s advice. “Jamie Lynn, don’t make a mistake you’ll regret for the rest of your life. I’ll never forget that last plea—of making a mistake I would regret—because it reinforced my decision to have my baby,” she wrote. Jamie Lynn also accused her father of trying to send her to a “home for unwed mothers,” where she would “eventually give up” her baby for adoption. “I will never forget when [a member of my team] stood up for me and said, ‘Y’all can’t force her to abort the baby.’ She was the first and only person on my team to show any support for my desire to keep my baby,” Jamie Lynn wrote. “The next option was for me to go to Mercy Ministries, a home for unwed mothers in Tennessee, where I could eventually give up my baby for adoption. Daddy and I fought, slinging words and tossing insults. He grabbed me by the shoulders and held on tightly in the hopes of bending me to his will. I got in his face and yelled, ‘NO! I won’t go.'” Jamie Lynn also revealed that she wasn’t allowed to tell Britney about the pregnancy because it was “too risky” for her sister to know. “My team believed everyone outside of the inner circle was a potential threat. They went so far as hiding my pregnancy from my sister, claiming, ‘It’s too risky to tell Britney about the baby,'” she wrote. “I needed her more than ever and she wasn’t able help me in my most vulnerable time. Britney’s condition was spiraling into something more concerning. They were concerned her instability at that time made her untrustworthy. I went along with what my team told me to do because I was a minor and didn’t want to create any more issues. Britney learned of the pregnancy when the article was released. To this day, the hurt of not being able to tell my sister myself lingers.” Jamie Lynn confessed that the pressure from her parents to “abort” her baby was so intense that she almost emancipated herself at 16 years old. “Britney was in the midst of her own crisis, and because we were isolated from each other, our communication was nonexistent,” she wrote. “My family denied my attempts to be independent and left me with no other choice than to threaten to file for emancipation with the courts. I spent days agonizing with my pending decision. But I followed my gut and instructed my new lawyer to go ahead and draw up the petition.” She continued, “The following Saturday morning, my lawyer and I showed up and served my momma with papers. Daddy was gone at that point, and Momma contacted the team to discuss the issues. They had real concerns about me marrying my boyfriend and giving him access to all of my earnings. Simultaneously, my sister was experiencing her own breakdown, and media speculation about her wellness and our family already had the paparazzi swarming. Everyone involved with my saga reluctantly agreed that we needed to do what was best to avoid any more negative media attention.” Things I Should Said by Jamie Lynn Spears hits shelves on January 18, 2022.

In a statement, the lobby, whose members had diverse opinions on the issue, asked the leaders to ""steer away from the polarised binary positions” saying these benefit no one. Instead, political parties should allow civil society to debate this important subject while respecting all opinions, rather than taking one side or the other. PN leader Bernard Grech said in a radio interview that no one in favour of abortion will be allowed to form part of, or represent the Nationalist Party. His comments came days after PN election candidate Emma Portelli Bonnici called for an end to the “systematic abuse of women who dare to speak about controversial views” after she was inundated by a barrage of hate speech over a comment about abortion comment that she never made. In September, Prime Minister Robert Abela had said that the debate on whether Malta should make abortion legal should continue but the ""rights of the unborn"" should be voiced. “No party has the right to stifle any discussion on any subject in a civilised country and we expect better from political leaders,” the lobby said. It added that If political leaders want fewer women to have an abortion they should offer them more support, introduce free contraception and make the morning after pill more freely available. They should also adopt a comprehensive sex education policy and strategy that addresses these issues without further delays, it insisted. Independent journalism costs money. Support Times of Malta for the price of a coffee."

During the show’s “Weekend Update” segment, Strong joined anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che dressed as the character Goober the Clown. “I had an abortion the day before my 23rd birthday … but it’s a rough subject, so we’re going to do fun clown stuff to make it more palpable,” she said, before detailing her own abortion, as well as her connections with people who have also had abortions. Goober the Clown (who had an abortion when she was 23) pic.twitter.com/1rFv6UrPGu — Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) November 7, 2021 “I wish I didn’t have to do this because the abortion I had at 23 is my personal clown business, but that’s all some people want to discuss all the time,” Strong continued. “I know I wouldn’t be a clown on TV here today if it weren’t for the abortion I had the day before my 23rd birthday. [Abortions are] gonna happen, so it ought to be safe, legal, and accessible.” The actress recently took to her Instagram Stories to confirm that she was drawing from personal experience in the sketch. “I didn’t tell my own wonderful and supportive mom for years and on Saturday I told live TV,” she wrote. Strong went on to say that she works with “the best people on earth,” thanking her fellow writers, and “@doylebird [for] being the first person I could text on Monday asking ‘is this an insane idea or…’ Because she’s not only a great friend she’s an amazing producer.” She added: “And thank you to Jost and Che (and all of SNL) for being on board immediately and giving this clown a seat at you table.” Saturday Night Live airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC.

One theme is that in Roe vs. Wade the Supreme Court held there was a right to privacy inherent in the 14th Amendment, therefore the states were limited, under the Constitution, as to which restrictions they could place on abortions. But… if there really is a right to privacy then how are Facebook, Google, and others allowed to use cookies to gather all kinds of private information about our comments on social media? — EJ Donmoyer, Paradise
2021-11-10	07:11:43+00:00	Unknown	Malta Today	‘You can’t be in favour of abortion and be part of the PN’, Grech says in strongest missive yet	https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/113194/you_cant_be_in_favour_of_abortion_and_be_part_of_the_pn_grech_says_in_strongest_missive_yet	PN leader Bernard Grech’s radio interview seals abortion debate conclusively inside PN: ‘As long as I am PN leader… nobody will be in favour of abortion and be in this party or as a representative of the party.’ Opposition leader Bernard Grech issued his clearest declaration yet against party representatives in favour of abortion, in a six-minute tirade on PN radio station Net FM. The Nationalist leader committed himself to a categorical anti-abortion stance by saying that he would not tolerate anyone representing the party to be in favour of abortion. “We can’t let Labour use delicate issues like these whenever it is overshadowed by its own wrongdoings,” Grech told journalist Dione Borg. “The abortion issue is a closed matter. This party was, is, will always be against abortion. It is a clear declaration I have made, that my predecessors have made, and it is our official position as laid down in the statute. Nobody, and I repeat nobody, as long as I am PN leader… will permit anyone to be in favour of abortion and stay in this party or as a representative of the party.” Grech’s strong comments reflect his long-held position on the issue, despite the presence of more vocal pro-choice members inside the PN. Yet Grech accused Labour of weaponising this difference in opinion against the PN, doubling down on his uncompromising stance. “If we want to be truly Nationalists and Christian-democrats, we’re obliged to say we’re against abortion, and act to let no mother of father, Maltese or not, commit such an act,” Grech said. “I hope there’s no Nationalist, no activist who’d call themselves Christian and Nationalist, who keeps believing Labour’s lies. Do not fall into this trap. As long as I’m here, this party will be pro-life.” He received an accolade on social media from senior cleric Mgr Anton Gouder, who posed the question to both political parties on Facebook and then feature their replies on his Facebook profile. Grech has already proposed that contraception and the morning-after-pill should be available free of charge to everyone over the age of 16 so as to reduce the demand for abortion. Grech’s categorical statements also open up questions about self-declared pro choice candidates like Emma Portelli Bonnici, who are at the forefront of party policy. A former Nationalist Party candidate, Hermann Farrugia, recently threatened to file an official complaint to the PN’s disciplinary committee against women in official posts at the party for espousing pro-choice views on sexual health and reproductive rights. In his radio interview, Grech also equated the challenge of climate crisis and the public demands for environmental preservation with the choice to terminate a pregnancy. “Are we going to talk about climate change, or the preservation of the environment for our future generations, but not be in favour of future generations themselves? We preserve a turtle’s eggs because we believe in that life, but not that of a newly-conceived baby? To us that is a human life that is important: the PN is against abortion, without any doubt.” Grech also called on politicians to be actively against abortion and assist couples undergoing challenges and considering a termination. “It is our obligation to protect life, and not say only that we’re against, but do our utmost to succour and support that mother or father considering a termination… it is no solution.”

Now, I’m not against learning lessons from historical analogies or considering the intellectual roots of ideas, but this is frequently taken to absurd extremes, with standards applied so inconsistently that history is cited to support the exact opposite of what it actually teaches.

2021-11-09	12:00:00+00:00	Unknown	catholicreview	The miracle we share at every Mass	https://catholicreview.org/the-miracle-we-share-at-every-mass/	 November 9, 2021By Greg Erlandson Filed Under: Commentary, Guest Commentary, Year of the Eucharist At their fall meeting, the bishops will have a chance to review, amend and vote on a draft statement titled “The Mystery of the Eucharist in the Life of the Church.” Much of the media coverage this year has focused on whether it will call out Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. According to the draft sent to the bishops in September and subsequently leaked to The Pillar, it does not. While this headline-grabbing, click-baiting controversy will again attract press coverage in November, it would be a shame if Catholics miss the real content of the document, a reflection on the church’s teachings on the Eucharist over the centuries. It contains many moving quotes and passages that all of us could benefit from contemplating every time we go to Mass. Here’s a sampling: Dorothy Day, while known best as a peace activist, had a profound devotion to the Eucharist. Her reflection is timely, as many Catholics may be slow to return to Mass after the pandemic closures. “Once, when told by someone she no longer saw the point of going to daily Mass, the servant of God Dorothy Day reflected: ‘We go eat of this fruit of the tree of life because Jesus told us to. … He took upon himself our humanity that we might share in his divinity. We are nourished by his flesh that we may grow to be other Christs. I believe this literally, just as I believe the child is nourished by the milk from his mother’s breast.'” Dorothy Day was a 20th-century Catholic. St. John Chrysostom was born only 300 years after Christ, yet he shared Day’s sense of the Eucharist as life giving: When you see the body of Christ, he preached, “set before you (on the altar), say to yourself: Because of this body I am no longer earth and ashes, no longer a prisoner, but free: because of this I hope for heaven, and to receive the good things therein, immortal life, the portion of angels, (and closeness) with Christ.” The document quotes St. Teresa of Kolkata: “When you look at the crucifix, you understand how much Jesus loved you then. When you look at the sacred host, you understand how much Jesus loves you now.” The draft document notes that “the word ‘Eucharist’ literally means ‘thanksgiving.’ Even our manner of giving thanks comes from God, for we do so by following the command of the Lord: Do this in memory of me.” It also says that it “is called Holy Communion precisely because, by placing us in intimate communion with the sacrifice of Christ, we are placed in intimate communion with him and through him, with each other.” St. Justin Martyr was born around the year 100, just a few decades after Christ walked the earth. Yet he was a witness to the early eucharistic faith of the church: “It is not ‘ordinary bread and ordinary drink’ that we receive in the Eucharist, but the flesh and blood of Christ, who came to nourish and transform us, to restore our relationship to God and to one another.” This communion turns us outward, recognizing our neighbor in the poor and the vulnerable. The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “to receive in truth the body and blood of Christ given up for us, we must recognize Christ in the poorest, his brethren.” The last word goes to Pope Benedict XVI: The “love that we celebrate in the sacrament is not something we can keep to ourselves. By its very nature, it demands to be shared by all.” Amen.
2021-11-09	11:04:13+00:00	Unknown	nationalpost	U.S. abortion curbs: Fearing business impact, companies speak out	https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/u-s-abortion-curbs-fearing-business-impact-companies-speak-out	Nov 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – U.S. firms look set to face increasing scrutiny over their stance on abortion rights and whether employee healthcare plans are in step with social responsibility statements as abortion curbs are challenged in court, researchers and executives say. A near-total ban on abortion in Texas and new restrictions on the procedure in other Republican-led states have prompted dozens of firms to wade into the highly charged debate – many speaking out publicly for the first time. As economists warn about the long-term impact of restricting abortion on employees and the bottom line, even more firms are likely to take a stand, said Shelley Alpern, head of corporate engagement at Rhia Ventures, a U.S.-based social enterprise. “Once it really sinks in that abortion restrictions hurt their workforce and talent pool, and that silence doesn’t put them in a good light, they will speak up more, if not publicly then in private conversations with lawmakers,” Alpern said. More than 80 companies with a combined revenue of more than $20 billion signed a statement in September denouncing Texas’s abortion law, which bans the procedure from about six weeks of pregnancy, including in rape and incest cases. The statement, organized by a coalition called “Don’t Ban Equality in Texas,” said “policies that restrict reproductive health care go against our values and are bad for business.” “The future of gender equality hangs in the balance, putting our families, communities, businesses and the economy at risk,” said the statement, signed by companies including Netflix, outdoor apparel brand Patagonia and ride hailing company Lyft. Such initiatives highlight a gradual shift in corporate thinking on abortion in public, which polls show most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases. Once seen only as a religious, women’s rights and health issue, abortion is becoming a badge for a company’s commitment to social responsibility, gender equality and workplace diversity. “Abortion rights will become another issue where companies will have to choose a side,” said Sarah Jackel, chief operating officer at Civitech, a tech and political data start-up that was among the signatories of the declaration against the Texas law. “The key factor to creating a successful business is hiring, training, resourcing, and retaining talented people. Texas’ abortion law endangers that process,” she said in emailed comments, noting businesses are struggling to fill vacancies as the U.S. economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. “The last thing businesses need are state laws that infringe on women’s rights and put employees in the position of having to quit their jobs or carry out an unwanted pregnancy,” said Jackel. Pressure for companies to take a stand on abortion is growing as the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, prepares to hear challenges to abortion restrictions, including one scheduled for Dec. 1 over a Mississippi law. Christopher Miller, head of global activism strategy at Ben & Jerry’s, said the ice cream company believes “it’s important to speak up and speak out on these issues.” “We see reproductive healthcare as a workplace issue,” Miller told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “If you’re operating in a state like Texas, it puts you at a competitive disadvantage. It makes it difficult to deliver on pay equity and recruiting and retaining talented leaders when there is a blatant attack against women,” he said. Two-thirds of college-educated adults said the Texas ban would discourage them from working in the state, according to an online poll conducted in August by PerryUndem, a nonpartisan Washington-based research firm. Abortion rights also influence decisions made by men, the survey found, with about half of male respondents saying they would not apply for a job in a state that passed a Texas-style abortion law. Some companies that have quietly been backing initiatives supporting women’s access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, are now being more open and vocal about it. “We’ve supported movements, organizations and initiatives focused on reproductive health – but we were not always explicit that this work included abortion,” said Carleen Pickard, ethical campaigns specialist at Lush, a cosmetics retailer. “No longer. Access to abortion is essential,” she added. Rachel J. Robasciotti, founder and chief executive of Adasina Social Capital, an investment and financial activism firm, said “abortion is an issue that businesses in the U.S. can no longer afford to ignore.” Publicly rejecting the Texas law is an obvious part of broader company efforts to foster gender equality, said Miriam Warren, chief diversity officer at crowdsourced business review website Yelp. “Gender equality cannot be truly achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” she said. A June study by the Washington-based Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) estimated state-level abortion restrictions cost the U.S. economy $105 billion a year. It found the curbs hit women’s participation in the workforce and their earnings, increasing turnover and time off from work among women. “Those lost earnings also translate to economic impacts for states themselves,” said Nicole Mason, head of IWPR. Research by the IWPR’s Center on the Economics of Reproductive Health included a range of abortion restrictions, including near-total bans like Texas’s, mandated counseling and waiting periods, and required parental consent for children. Without such abortion limitations, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) would be nearly half a percentage point greater and an additional 505,000 women aged 15 to 44 would enter the workforce earning about $3 billion annually, the research found. But though women make up roughly half of the U.S. workforce, many firms do not know what kind of reproductive healthcare – including abortion – they offer as part of insurance plans, found a 2020 report by Rhia Ventures. Nearly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion in their lifetime. “A lot of companies just don’t check (because it is) not thought of as something that is valued and that people would value,” said Camila Novo-Viano, one of the authors of the report, which was based on interviews with human resource and benefits managers at 39 companies. “It was just not something that was on the top of their minds, and it comes from this belief that abortion is not a key part of reproductive health and is not something many women need,” said Novo-Viano, a senior consultant with the FSG consulting firm. With abortion rights being put to the test over the coming months, more companies are likely to weigh in. “We are organized and pushing back because we realize the impact that S.B. 8 (Texas law) and any copycat bills will have on safety for all employees, as well as on doing business in general,” said Pickard at Lush.

She’s capable of multitudes. Just witness her appearance on Weekend Update on this past weekend’s Kieran Culkin-hosted SNL. She took one of the touchiest subjects in the nation right now — a woman’s right to have a safe and legal abortion, currently under assault in Texas, with other states soon to possibly follow — and turned it into something that was hilarious and sobering at the same time. Strong’s idea was simple and strange: She appeared as a clown named Goober. That someone caked in white greasepaint, a big red nose, a spinning bowtie, and an army of balloons (plus a non-functioning horn) was there to address the draconian abortion laws enacted in Texas in September may have seemed incongruous at first. How does one mine laughs out of the idea that women are forced to carry a pregnancy all the way to childbirth if it’s not detected in the six weeks, before most women even know they’re pregnant? But Strong found a way to at least soften the blow: She pretended she was talking about clowns, not women. She told the crowd she “really” doesn’t want to talk about “freaking abortion,” partly “because the abortion I had at 23 is my personal clown business.” But she had to because “people keep bringing it up.” So, she said, “we’re gonna do fun clown stuff to make it more palatable. The jokes, such as they were, went like this. “Did you know one in three clowns will have a clown abortion in her lifetime?” Strong’s Goober asked. “You don’t, because they don’t tell you. They don’t even know how to talk to other clowns about it, because when they do talk about it, if you were a clown who wasn’t the victim of something sad like clown-cest, they think your clown abortion wasn’t a ‘righteous clown abortion.’” Throughout Goober essentially copied-and-pasted “clown” for “woman,” telling stories about what she’s been through since her abortion at a young age. “Years later, you’ll be at a dinner with a big group of clowns and one clown will go out on a limb and say she’s had an abortion,” Goober said. “And then like eight other clowns at the table say they’ve had an abortion too, because that’s how common it is!” Perhaps it wasn’t immediately apparent what Strong was doing, namely that she was using one of the most scrutinized programs on national television to speak, in a semi-direct and humorous yet blunt manner, about what it’s like for women who’ve had abortions. It shows, in the form of a wacky Weekend Update monologue, how woman are forced to hide what they’ve gone through, have trouble speaking to others about their ordeals, all while having to fight to make sure it remains safe and legal. “We will not go back to the alley,” she concluded. “I mean, the last thing anyone wants is a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley.” But what Strong did with “Goober the Clown” did not go unnoticed. As the sketch made its way through social media, many took the time to praise Strong for doing something personal and brave. It takes real lips to do something so personal and true in comedy I love you Cecily Strong https://t.co/Gi89QAgd9J — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) November 8, 2021 This is brilliant, from Cecily Strong. #ClownAbortion https://t.co/OqLqdSq8pn — Rachel Parris (@rachelparris) November 8, 2021 I only figured out the brutal honesty underlying this sketch on second viewing, and still believe Cecily Strong deserves an Emmy. https://t.co/VpHOYtYJ09 — White Guy Confidence (Sustainably) (@karenkho) November 8, 2021 WOW.I think Cecily Strong just made one of the most bravely personal admissions and appeals ever, couched as a clown gag on @nbcsnl SNL's Weekend Update. Holy shit. And bravo, woman. — Joe Niedbala (@Scortch1) November 7, 2021 Cecily Strong's manic clown abortion Weekend Update is an amazing bit of commentary on the need to dress up & distance ourselves from any & all abortion discourse, while still essentially allowing Cecily to deliver a personal, straight-down-the-middle monologue on abortion. #SNL — Delia Harrington (@DeliaMary) November 7, 2021 Holy shit. Abortion clown almost made me cry, while I was laughing?

November 8, 2021 The Rev. Gayle Evers grew up in a “super conservative” family. The co-pastor of Journey Imperfect Faith Community in Austin says she has wrestled with reproductive rights for a long time. That is, until September, when Texas implemented the strictest abortion law the country has seen since Roe v. Wade established abortion as a constitutional right almost 50 years ago. Abortion is a complicated issue in many faith communities. One effect of Texas’ strict new abortion law, SB8, has been to spur people to wrestle more deeply with the topic – and to clarify their feelings around it. “With SB8 I had to stand up and say no,” says Ms. Evers. “It absolutely shreds the fabric of trust in our society.” And “it not only judges delicate, complicated situations with an iron fist; it prejudges them.” Faith featured prominently as state lawmakers advanced the law. “Our creator endowed us with the right to life,” said Republican Gov. Greg Abbott when he signed the law. But for some people of faith, it has inspired a newfound interest in, and activism around, reproductive rights – both in Texas and beyond. “Faith is about how we love each other and help each other,” says Joan Lamunyon Sanford, executive director of the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, who has been helping Texas women obtain legal abortions in her state. “A law that turns family members against family members, or neighbors against neighbors ... that’s not faith.” Growing up in a “super conservative” family in Tennessee didn’t lead the Rev. Gayle Evers to become a conservative pastor. Now based in Austin, Texas, she is co-pastor of Journey Imperfect Faith Community, and a chaplain for a group that ministers to LGBTQ people of faith and their families. She has been active for LGBTQ rights for several years. Reproductive rights, however, are something she has wrestled with for a long time. That is, until September, when Texas implemented the strictest abortion law the country has seen since Roe v. Wade established abortion as a constitutional right almost 50 years ago. Abortion is a complicated issue in many faith communities. One effect of Texas’ strict new abortion law, SB8, has been to spur people to wrestle more deeply with the topic – and to clarify their feelings around it. “With SB8 I had to stand up and say no,” says Ms. Evers. “It absolutely shreds the fabric of trust in our society,” she adds. And “it not only judges delicate, complicated situations with an iron fist; it prejudges them.” The specifics of the law are well documented. SB8 bans any abortion after six weeks, before women often know they’re pregnant, but state officials are also banned from enforcing the law. Instead, private citizens, anywhere in the United States, have been deputized to bring suits against anyone, anywhere in the state, who “aids or abets” someone in getting an abortion. The law includes no exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. Faith featured prominently as state lawmakers advanced the law this spring. “Our creator endowed us with the right to life,” said Republican Gov. Greg Abbott when he signed the law in May. But for some people of faith, it has inspired a newfound interest in, and activism around, reproductive rights – both in Texas and beyond. “Faith is about how we love each other and help each other,” says Joan Lamunyon Sanford, executive director of the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (NMRCRC). “A law that turns family members against family members, or neighbors against neighbors ... that’s not faith.” “To us that’s the most egregious part of this, is that it uses faith as a way to harm and discriminate – which unfortunately is not new, but, you know, we don’t need to keep doing that,” she adds. Amid a bevy of court challenges, SB8 has largely remained in effect since Sept. 1. A majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices appeared open to letting abortion providers challenge the law last week, when they heard a fast-tracked appeal. The high court could still overturn the constitutional right to abortion nationwide in a separate case it will hear next month. For now SB8 has had telling effects in Texas. The number of abortions in the state in September dropped by about 50% compared with September 2020, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a group of university-based researchers. The average drive to an abortion clinic has increased from 17 miles to 247 miles, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for reproductive rights. At least 300 Texans traveled to Oklahoma in September seeking an abortion, “PBS NewsHour” reported. That same month, Planned Parenthood clinics in Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico saw a 132% increase in patients from Texas compared with the month before, according to Planned Parenthood of the Rockies. Texans as a whole are divided on the restriction itself. Forty-seven percent of Texas voters oppose banning abortions as early as six weeks, and 45% approve, according to a University of Texas-Texas Tribune poll. But 57% of voters oppose the law’s “bounty” provision, including 35% of Republicans. In Albuquerque, the controversy has driven some people to get more involved with NMRCRC. “I was kind of helping from afar,” says one volunteer who, for privacy reasons, asked to only be identified as Crystal. She had been donating, and attending the occasional rally in Santa Fe, the state capital. “After the Texas law, I kind of figured volume would pick up and they’d need more people,” adds Crystal. “It’s kind of what brought me back.” Part of NMRCRC’s work includes logistical support for people traveling to Albuquerque from out of state to get an abortion. Crystal’s role is to be the driver. She takes people to and from the airport, to and from the clinic, and to and from where they’re staying. When they talk, she tries not to dig too much. But one passenger last month has stuck with her. “All she wanted to do was get back home to her family,” says Crystal. The woman, from the Houston area, “was worried about somebody finding out,” Crystal adds. But “she just wanted to go home and get back to her life.” With grown children herself, she found the story “heartbreaking.” “I don’t know that I would be able to handle it that well,” says Crystal. “I think it would’ve been much harder for me.” The right to abortion faces an uncertain future around the country. Twelve states have passed “trigger” laws that would automatically ban abortion in the state if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, which could be an outcome in the case it’s hearing next month, Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women Health. Over the decades, Christianity – in particular white evangelical Christianity – has come to be viewed as synonymous with the anti-abortion movement. “Scripture tells us to rescue those who are being taken away to death,” said William Ascol at this year’s Southern Baptist Convention, when introducing a resolution calling for the abolition of abortion. But the reality, and the history, are more complicated. Abortion was legal under common law in the U.S. from the country’s founding until 1880, when the first restrictions were passed at the behest, not of the church, but of the medical establishment. For the first 100 years or so, women had until “quickening” – roughly 15 weeks, when they could feel a fetus moving – to decide whether to continue a pregnancy. Some legal scholars argue that originalists on the Supreme Court should take this history into account when deciding Dobbs later this year. The early abortion-rights movement favored moral and religious arguments more than its opponents. Indeed, in the 1970s, the Southern Baptist Convention passed resolutions affirming that women should have access to abortion. Today, polling shows that a majority of most religious traditions in the country believe abortion should be illegal. The Rev. Angela Williams, an ordained pastor and an outreach coordinator with the progressive Texas Freedom Network, has been working for five years with congregations to pierce “a conspiracy of silence around reproductive health issues,” as its website describes it. The work has been difficult. “Individuals may be ready to say, ‘I care about this [issue],’” she says. But it can be tough “as people work through the implications in [their] congregation.” “It doesn’t feel as urgent until something like SB8 happens,” she adds. But now, congregations “are coming to us saying, ‘What can we do? How can we change this?’” Abortion has long been a complicated issue in many faith communities. In some ways, another effect of SB8 has been to clarify feelings around what has long been an uncomfortable topic. But seeking more clarity doesn’t mean disregarding how complicated the issue of abortion is for people of faith, says the Rev. Daniel Kanter, senior minister of the First Unitarian Church of Dallas. “To just ideologically say ‘abortion should be outlawed’ is to miss the complexity,” he says. Mr. Kanter’s views on the issue are well known. He is one of the plaintiffs who sued in August to stop SB8 from going into effect, and part of his work involves counseling women who are considering getting an abortion. “I would say you can’t be pro-life and go past the life you see in front of you: the woman,” he says. But now, with SB8’s “bounty” system in effect, he isn’t sure he can even help them navigate that complexity, lest he also be sued. “I haven’t been in a situation in which I’ve had to censor what I am able to talk about with a member of my congregation. But this is [now] the consideration,” he says. For Ms. Evers in Austin, she believes she is on a similar journey as the one she made on LGBTQ rights, which she used to think were sinful. Then, in her 20s, she became friends with a colleague who was gay and who died after being diagnosed with AIDS. For 30 years, she wrestled with the tension between what she knew to be true – “that these are good people” – and how it could be reconciled with what the Bible had taught her. “I believed that being gay was not a sin; it was normal,” she adds. But “I needed to let my heart catch up with my mind.” Get stories that empower and uplift daily. On abortion, she’s “still in that liminal space,” she continues. She plans to continue pondering it, and she plans to ponder it with members of the Journey Imperfect Faith Community in the coming months. “My heart is behind my mind,” she says. “But I expect my heart will catch up.” Already a subscriber?

2021-11-08	20:51:57+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	alternet	After the GOP's sweep, Virginia’s AG-elect takes aim at reform prosecutors	https://www.alternet.org/2021/11/virginia-ag/	"Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates William J. Howell presiding over the House on January 12, 2012 The impact of the Republican sweep in Virginia on November 2 won't be limited to Glenn Youngkin's winning his dog-whistle gubernatorial campaign. Attorney General-elect Jason Miyares, an ardent opponent of gun control and abortion, similarly squeaked home against his Democratic opponent with under 51 percent of the vote. And he has immediately signaled that he will pursue new legislation to usurp prosecutorial discretion from Virginia's locally elected county prosecutors, known as commonwealth's attorneys. His clear purpose echoes Youngkin's fear-mongering against so-called ""progressive prosecutors."" In recent years, several reform candidates have trounced conservative Democrats in Commonwealth's Attorney elections across the state. Their jurisdictions tend to be heavily Democratic-leaning areas — like Arlington, where Commonwealth's Attorney Parisa Dehghani-Tafti has made moves to grant leniency in even large-scale cannabis cases; and Portsmouth, where Commonwealth's Attorney Stephanie Morales became one of the rare top local prosecutors to successfully prosecute an on-duty police officer for killing a civilian. As Miyares has explained, the proposed bill would give the state attorney general concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute local cases where the commonwealth's attorney refuses to charge. By launching an attack on these prosecutors' autonomy, Miyares can gratify both the law-and-order fanatics of his base and those who generally want to see Democrats punished. ""Tough-on-crime"" leaders in other states, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a conservative Democrat, have also taken this approach as a way to undercut the gains of the progressive prosecutor movement. But even those who don't share the view that reducing arrests and incarceration is a good thing may have qualms about removing the discretion of prosecutors who were, after all, elected. In Indiana, for example, controversy brewed when Marion County Prosecuting Attorney Ryan Mears announced he would no longer prosecute low-level cannabis possession cases. The Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council, which represents the state's elected prosecutors, is so conservative as a whole that it opposes even medical cannabis programs. But the association also continues to oppose efforts to strip prosecutorial discretion, with IPAC Senior Counsel Dave Powelll even calling it the profession's ""holy grail."" Back in Virginia, the legality of stripping a Commonwealth's Attorney of discretion over their cases is also unclear. When Norfolk Commonwealth's Attorney Greg Underwood attempted to dismiss misdemeanor cannabis cases in bulk in 2019, trial court judges opposed the move. The Virginia Supreme Court then sided with the local judges. But legislation to abrogate that decision and give dismissal authority back to prosecutors was signed by the governor the following year. On top of that, the Virginia Supreme Court's analysis could have been wrong; it simply relied on state common law tradition from as early as 1803. In contrast, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court heard a similar case in 2021, it came to the opposite conclusion. This was essentially due to the Consitution's separation of powers doctrine. To that court, the ability to decide to prosecute cases exists solely in prosecutors, who are officials located in the executive branch. The fact that none of this would give Miyares pause is little surprise. He used to work as a prosecutor in Virginia Beach, and Colin Stolle, the commonwealth's attorney there, has received his political endorsement. Stolle is notoriously draconian toward the pettiest forms of lawbreaking. When Virginia still had a ""habitual drunkard"" statute that allowed commonwealth's attorneys to petition to put homeless people with alcohol use disorder on a registry, making it a crime for them to even possess alcohol, the Virginia Beach Commonwealth's Attorney Office used the statute more than any other—four times more often than the second-placed office. The law was later ruled unconstitutional by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Miyares' transition team is also troubling. One of its members, Lynchburg Commonwealth's Attorney Bethany Harrison, worked for the Family Foundation, a nonprofit that seeks to ""advocate for policies based on Biblical principles that enable families to flourish at the state and local level."" It works to ban abortion, and also trafficks in anti-transgender hate. As an assistant prosecutor, Harrison led a program to train local residents as ""citizen-informants"" to ensure more drug crimes got reported. Another team member is Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman, who staved off progressive Democrat Justin Hannah in 2019. Rather than focusing on crime, Chapman flings himself into culture wars (sound familiar?). Earlier this year, after some people complained about a local anti-racist parent group on Facebook, he launched a formal criminal probe for evidence of ""racketeering"" by the activists. It was also Chapman's deputies who, at a recent school board meeting, decided to arrest and recommend the prosecution of the father of a student who was allegedly sexually assaulted—though it was Buta Biberaj, the district's progressive prosecutor, who received death threats for the decision. Virginia's under-fire elected prosecutors have already announced their intent to resist the brazen moves of the Miyares administration. Ramin Fatehi, the new Norfolk commonwealth's attorney-elect, tweeted in response that ""we are not going to let Jason Miyares feed mass incarceration for political points."" And after Tom Cotton, the hyperconservative US senator from Arkansas, praised Miyares for trying to strip the discretion of ""pro-criminal Soros 'prosecutors,'"" Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano tweeted that ""we're gonna keep building a system that treats working folks & communities of color fairly.""

The flight scheduled for 2.35 pm had departed the Benin Airport terminal for the runway with its passengers. However, just as it gathered speed and at the point of lift-off, it suffered a bird strike causing the pilot to immediately lower its nose to abort the flight. The pilot announced that there had been a bird strike and the plane could no longer take off. The Boeing aircraft named Kinglsely Onyeama with registration number 5N FYI taxied back to the terminal where engineers immediately began to assess the damage. The passengers remained in the aircraft on the tarmac for nearly an hour before they were asked to disembark. They were requested to return to the departure hall and wait for another aircraft that would be arriving from Lagos. A top official of the Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Mr Godwin Ujuanbi, who confirmed the incident explained that bird strikes are a regular occurrence at the airport. Ujuanbi said that the passengers had to board an Arik Air flight which was readily available following the grounding of the aircraft. The official explained that the flight was aborted as aircraft engines are very sensitive, adding that technicians from FAAN were immediately dispatched to remove the feathers and other remains of the bird. Ujuanbi said: “Here in Benin Airport we are always battling with birds. Aircraft engines are very sensitive and had no choice to ground the plane following the bird strike. We have a department that routinely shoots the birds. It is a common experience in most airports. The passengers flew on Arik Air to Abuja as it wàs the only one available. The aircraft was not damaged.” In spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.

Politicians are pointing fingers at each other over their paid sidelines in the wake of the bitter row over Boris Johnson's abortive bid to save ally Owen Paterson from punishment for lobbying. The PM said this morning that he expected outside income for MPs to be 'looked at' - with the standards committee set to make recommendations before Christmas. Labour is pushing for paid directorships and consultancy roles to be banned - although Keir Starmer says nurses and other professions should be allowed to continue. But the Tories have pointed out that a number of Opposition MPs also have some outside earnings alongside their salaries of around £82,000 a year. Mr Cox, an eminent QC, has long been one of the biggest earners in the Commons. In the latest register of interest, the Torridge and West Devon MP revealed that from this month he is receiving £400,000 a year plus VAT for 41 hours' work a month as Consultant Global Counsel to Withers LLP. Mr Cox, an eminent QC, has long been one of the biggest earners in the Commons. In the latest register of interest, the Torridge and West Devon MP revealed that from this month he is receiving £400,000 a year plus VAT for 41 hours' work a month as Consultant Global Counsel to Withers LLP. That is actually a reduction on the £468,000 he was receiving for doing 48 hours in the same role in the previous year. Mr Cox's entry includes some £570,000 more income for legal work. The register notes that 13.5 per cent goes towards the costs of his legal chambers. There is no suggestion that Mr Cox has broken any rules. But Labour MP Karl Turner tweeted: 'How does ⁦@Geoffrey_Cox⁩ find time to do his job as a constituency MP, keep his own legal practise going from his chambers and is a consultant to @WithersLLP earning 400K plus VAT p/a as an advisor.' Asked about the idea of curbing second jobs on a visit in Northumberland today, Mr Johnson said: 'I think that all those kinds of things are issues that the Speaker's panel – whatever he sets up – is going to have a look at.' Asked about the idea of curbing second jobs on a visit in Northumberland today (pictured), Mr Johnson said: 'I think that all those kinds of things are issues that the Speaker's panel – whatever he sets up – is going to have a look at.' Owen Paterson was found by the Standards Committee to have engaged in 'egregious' lobbying on behalf of two companies which paid him a combined total of more than £100,000 per year Earlier, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan was asked on Sky News whether MPs should be allowed to have second jobs. She said: 'I think the question of whether MPs having jobs that involve lobbying, I think, perhaps should be looked at again. 'Across the board, I don't think we should have a removal of the ability to maintain or have a second job because it brings a richness to our role as Members of Parliament as well as the work we do day to day with our constituents.' The Register of Members' Financial Interests shows 34 MPs have been declaring payments for consultancy or advisory work. They include Owen Paterson, who was found by the Standards Committee to have engaged in 'egregious' lobbying on behalf of two companies which paid him a combined total of more than £100,000 per year. He has now resigned from the Commons and said he is stopping his consultancy duties. There are no rules against MPs being paid for advising external businesses, provided they record it in their register of interests, but they must not lobby the Government on behalf of those businesses.

2021-11-08	16:05:23+00:00	The Associated Press	libn	Supreme Court questions controversial Texas abortion law	https://libn.com/2021/11/08/supreme-court-questions-controversial-texas-abortion-law/	 By: The Associated Press November 8, 2021 Comments Off on Supreme Court questions controversial Texas abortion law A majority of the Supreme Court signaled Monday they would allow abortion providers to pursue a court challenge to the controversial Texas law that has virtually ended abortion in the nation’s second-largest state after six weeks of pregnancy. But it was unclear how quickly the court would rule and whether it would issue an order blocking the law that has been in effect for two months, or require providers to ask a lower court to put the law on hold. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, two conservative appointees of former President Donald Trump, voted in September to allow the law to take effect, but they raised questions Monday about its novel structure. The law, written to make it difficult to mount legal challenges, subjects clinics, doctors and any others who facilitate abortions to large financial penalties. “Millions and millions retroactively imposed, even though the activity was perfectly lawful under all court orders and precedent at the time it was undertaken, right?” Kavanaugh asked, one of several skeptical questions he put to Judd E. Stone II, representing Texas. Barrett, too, pressed Stone about provisions of the law that force providers to fight lawsuits one by one and, she said, don’t allow their constitutional rights to be “fully aired.” The justices heard three hours of arguments Monday in two cases over whether abortion providers or the Justice Department can mount federal court challenges to the law, which has an unusual enforcement scheme its defenders argue shields it from federal court review. The Biden administration filed its lawsuit after the justices voted 5-4 to refuse a request by providers to keep the law on hold. Justice Neil Gorsuch, also a Trump appointee, and two other conservative justices joined Barrett and Kavanaugh in the majority to let the law take effect. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court’s three liberal justices in dissent. The justices sounded less convinced that the Justice Department lawsuit should go forward, and Justice Elena Kagan suggested that a ruling instead in favor of the providers would allow the court to avoid difficult issues of federal power. In neither case argued Monday is the right to an abortion directly at issue. But the motivation for the lawsuits is that the Texas law conflicts with landmark Supreme Court rulings that prevent a state from banning abortion early in pregnancy. Arguing for the United States, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that Texas’ law was enacted in “open defiance” of Supreme Court precedent. “It enacted a law that clearly violates this court’s precedents,” she said. Under the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, states are prevented from banning abortion before viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks of pregnancy. The justices will hear a separate challenge to those decisions in a case over Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks. Those arguments are set for Dec. 1. The most direct reference to the Mississippi case came from Justice Samuel Alito, who asked if the decision by providers to stop doing abortions in Texas “is attributable to the fear of liability if Roe or Casey is altered?” But most questions focused on the Texas law and how it has altered abortion in the state even before the high court has made any change in abortion law. Kagan told Stone that until Texas passed its law, “no state dreamed” of trying to make an end-run around Supreme Court precedent in the same way. If the Supreme Court doesn’t do anything about that, she said, it would be inviting states to try to flout precedent: “Guns. Same-sex marriage. Religious rights. Whatever you don’t like: go ahead,” she said. Kagan, who disagreed with her colleagues’ decision to let the law take effect, said Texas’ law has prevented women in Texas “from exercising a constitutional right.” Kavanaugh also raised concerns about laws that might affect other constitutional rights. The Texas law has been in effect since September when the Supreme Court declined to intervene, except for a 48-hour period in early October when it was blocked by a lower court. The high court got involved again less than two weeks ago, moving at extraordinary speed. The court offered no explanation for its decision to hear the cases so quickly. If the court allows the providers to continue their lawsuit, it would still take a separate order from the justices or a lower court to put the law on hold. Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Woman’s Health, said her four clinics would resume abortion services if they get a favorable court order. The Texas ban, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortion after cardiac activity is detected in a fetus, usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant. The law makes exceptions for medical emergencies but not for rape or incest. A study published by researchers at the University of Texas found that the number of abortions statewide fell by 50% after the law took effect in September, compared to the same month in 2020. The study was based on data from 19 of the state’s 24 abortion clinics, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. At least 12 other states have enacted bans early in pregnancy, but all have been blocked from going into effect. Rather than have state officials enforce the law, Texas deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who performs or aids and abets an abortion. If someone bringing suit is successful, they are entitled to at least $10,000. Women who obtain abortions can’t be sued under the law. During arguments Monday, Roberts at one point asked whether the law could be challenged if Texas had made the entitlement much higher, $1 million. Texas’ lawyer told him no. The structure of the law threatens abortion providers with huge financial penalties if they violate it. Clinics throughout the state have stopped performing abortions once cardiac activity is found. The result, both the providers and the Biden administration said, is that women who are financially able have traveled to other states and those without the means must either continue their pregnancies against their will or find other, potentially dangerous ways to end them. Stone and Jonathan Mitchell, an architect of the law who also argued Monday, defended the law and its unusual structure.

The PM was lambasted by Opposition politicians as the Commons held an emergency debate in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal - which Mr Johnson avoided by saying he could not get back from a visit to Northumberland in time. MPs also branded the Prime Minister a 'tin-pot dictator' and accused him of behaving like Vladimir Putin over his reaction to sleaze - as the Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle warned that Parliament's standards commissioner must not be publicly undermined. The Prime Minister had earlier attempted to bat away criticism for failing to attend the debate, refusing to apologise and claiming there is 'not much more to say' about the Paterson case. Many Tory MPs followed his example with only around 50 - just one in seven of the total - present in the Commons for the debate. But of one of those who did take part, former chief whip Mark Harper, slammed the PM for not taking part. Mr Harper, who voted against the Government to oppose easing sanctions on Mr Paterson last week, said that as 'team captain' Mr Johnson should have been present tonight to apologise for last week's vote, adding: 'That's the right thing to do in terms of demonstrating leadership.' Anger turned to derision during the debate, with SNP politician Peter Wishart comparing Mr Johnson to 'Brave Sir Robin', the cowardly knight in the comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He said: 'It should be [Boris Johnson] in this debate. It was him who brought that grubby motion to the debate last Wednesday. It was him who defended it to the highest hilt... He should be standing here defending the Government's actions and telling us what he's going to do. 'Now he always likes to remind me of battles of past, can I say to him today he's like the Brave Sir Robin from Monty Python from the Holy Grail bravely running away from doing his duty at the dispatch box,' he added, as the Commons erupted in laughter, with even Jacob Rees-Mogg smiling at the jibe. Speaker Mr Hoyle opened the session by warning that Mr Johnson's abortive bid to save ally Owen Paterson from lobbying punishment had been highly damaging to parliament's reputation. Sir Lindsay warned that everyone must stop 'political sniping' and work across parties to clear up this 'mess'. And in an apparent jibe at ministers, he defended watchdog Kathryn Stone - who has been subjected to death threats after the row. 'Please do not criticise the commissioner for standards who is doing the job that we have appointed her to do.' Despite the entreaties from the Speaker, one Labour MP immediately swiped that Mr Johnson had acted like a 'tin-pot dictator'. And Lib Dem Wendy Chamberlain said events had been more reminiscent of the 'Duma in Moscow' than Westminster. The blustering came as an Ipsos MORI poll for the Standard gave the latest indication that the party has taken a huge hit, even though ministers have dismissed the row as a 'storm in a teacup'. Although much of the fieldwork was carried out before the dramatic vote last Wednesday, the Tories were down four points since September on 35 per cent. Crucially that was below Labour, with Keir Starmer's party on 36 per cent support. It is the first time in a year that Labour has been ahead with the pollster. Sir Keir seized on Mr Johnson's absence, accusing him of 'corruption', of 'damaging democracy' and lacking 'the decency either to defend or apologise for his actions'. 'His concern as always is self-preservation, not the national interest,' he said. Many Tory MPs followed his example with around 50 - just one in seven of the total - present in the Commons for the debate. Lib Dem Wendy Chamberlain (right) said events had been more reminiscent of the 'Duma in Moscow' than Westminster. Left, Owen Paterson (file picture) MPs traded blows about their second jobs - with Tory Geoffrey Cox under fire for his extraordinary £1million a year legal earnings. Politicians are pointing fingers at each other over their paid sidelines in the wake of the bitter row over Boris Johnson's abortive bid to save ally Owen Paterson from punishment for lobbying. The PM said this morning that he expected outside income for MPs to be 'looked at' - with the standards committee set to make recommendations before Christmas. Labour is pushing for paid directorships and consultancy roles to be banned - although Keir Starmer says nurses and other professions should be allowed to continue. But the Tories have pointed out that a number of Opposition MPs also have some outside earnings alongside their salaries of around £82,000 a year. Mr Cox, an eminent QC, has long been one of the biggest earners in the Commons. In the latest register of interest, the Torridge and West Devon MP revealed that from this month he is receiving £400,000 a year plus VAT for 41 hours' work a month as Consultant Global Counsel to Withers LLP. Cabinet minister Steve Barclay, representing the government in lieu of Mr Johnson, voiced 'regret' for the 'mistake' that was made in overturning the standards committee report last week. The PM insisted he was unable to get back from a 'long-planned' visit to the North East in time for the Commons debate. No10 blamed the fact he is travelling by train - even though it did not start until around after 4pm. However, witnesses spotted the PM on a train that arrived at London King's Cross station less than half an hour into the Commons debate, which started at 4.07pm, reports The Mirror. 'I don't think there is much more to be said about that particular case,' he told reporters in a scratchy interview during which he constantly tried to change the subject to Covid. The debate dodge has echoes of Mr Johnson's decision when Foreign Secretary to make a whistlestop visit to Afghanistan on the day of the crunch vote on expanding Heathrow Airport - something he might otherwise have needed to resign to oppose. Mr Johnson also came under fire from his own side for continuing to seek reform of the standards system separate from Mr Paterson's case. Former minister Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP in the Commons, said: 'The current system can work if we make it work.' Ms Chamberlain, who secured the emergency debate, said: 'This is almost the kind of behaviour we would expect to see in the Duma in Moscow, National People's Congress in Beijing, not in the House of Commons. 'Previous prime ministers and previous governments have all had their failings, but it's a long time since we have seen these issues and the absolute lack of resolve to do anything about it. 'They say a fish rots from the head down, and I'm disappointed to see that the Prime Minister has chosen not to turn up to today to answer questions, given that the leader of the opposition is in his place. 'You can't help but feel that he thinks the rules don't apply to him.' Intervening, Labour's Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi (Slough) branded the Prime Minister a 'tin-pot dictator who himself is now mired in sleaze'. His words prompted the a rebuke from the Speaker, who said: 'Please moderate language, moderate thoughts, let's do this right.' In a starkly different tone to that adopted by Mr Johnson, Mr Barclay said he and his colleagues on the Government frontbench 'regret' the 'mistake' they made last week. He told MPs: 'I'd like, first and foremost, to express my regret and that of my ministerial colleagues over the mistake made last week. 'We recognise there are concerns across the House over the standards system and also the process by which possible breaches of the code of conduct are investigated. 'Yet whilst sincerely held concerns clearly warrant further attention, the manner in which the Government approached last week's debate conflated them with the response to an individual case. 'This House shares a collective interest in ensuring that the code of conduct reflects and fosters the highest standards of public life.' The premier has been left fighting on multiple fronts after he was accused of targeting standards commissioner Kathryn Stone following a series of clashes. He could still face a Commons investigation into the funding of his 'Wallpapergate' renovation of the No11 residence. Cabinet ministers defended the way seats in the House of Lords are dished out amid a sleaze row involving wealthy Tory donors. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan praised the 'rich mix' of backgrounds in the upper chamber after claims were made about access for senior party figures. A Sunday Times report yesterday showed 15 of the last 16 Conservative Party treasurers have been offered a seat in the Lords, having each donated more than £3 million to the party. The Tories have denied any link between the donations and the nominations to sit in the Lords, in the latest twist in ongoing allegations of sleaze in Parliament. On Monday, Ms Trevelyan said the chamber had a 'rich mix which brings a real depth of voices to our political parties across the piste. And Mr Johnson has also refused to declare his recent 'freebie' holiday to Spain on the parliamentary register - instead unusually using the ministerial interests list, which meant he did not have to disclose the value of the gift. In the three-hour Commons debate this afternoon, MPs are calling on Mr Johnson categorically to rule out a peerage for Mr Paterson and to launch an investigation into £600million of Covid contracts awarded to one of the firms he worked for. But speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a hospital in Hexham earlier, the PM confirmed he will not be there in person. 'What we've got to make sure is that we take all this very, very seriously and that we get it right,' he said. 'There's a debate today, unfortunately I can't be there because I had a long-standing engagement up here.' The PM said opposition parties wanted to focus on 'a particular case, a particular MP who suffered a serious personal tragedy, and who's now resigned'. He said: 'I don't think there's much more to be said about that particular case, I really don't, but what we do need to do is look also at the process, and that is what we were trying to do last week.' He said he hoped there would be 'cross-party agreement on a way forward, including an appeals process'. 'I have the utmost respect for the Speaker and his general desire to produce a cross-party outcome, cross-party reform of the system, which is what we were trying to achieve last week,' he said. Asked if MPs should be banned from taking second jobs, Mr Johnson said: 'All those kind of things are issues that the Speaker's panel – whatever he is going to set up – will have a look at.' Vandals have daubed graffiti across the constituency office of a North Wales Tory MP after he voted to stop Owen Paterson from being suspended. The words 'corrupt scum' have been spray-painted in red across the windows outside the building on Princes Drive, Colwyn Bay, where Clwyd West MP David Jones is based. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson whipped his MPs to support an amendment not to suspend North Shropshire Tory, Owen Paterson, after he was found guilty of paid lobbying by a standards watchdog. Mr Jones, from Rhos on Sea, who has represented Clwyd West since 2005, voted in favour of putting aside Paterson's suspension and reviewing the standards system. The graffiti attack on Mr Jones' offices also damaged a grief counselling charity, Cruse Bereavement, which is next door. Mr Jones declined to comment. He added: 'If there is anything positive to come out of the whole thing, it is that, as far as I can make out, the Speaker is determined to try to move us all forward with a system whereby we have a cross-party approach, which is what we were trying achieve last week.' Pressed on whether Mr Paterson could be in line for a peerage, he said: 'There has been absolutely no discussion of that.' No10 said the premier is travelling by train. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay will represent the government instead. Reminded that Mr Johnson had flown back from the COP26 summit last week apparently in order to attend a social dinner, the spokesman said: 'I gave you the reason for that flight before.' He added: 'We think the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, whose department is the lead on this area, is the right person to lead (the debate).' Labour MP Catherin McKinnell was among those deriding Mr Johnson's inability to make the 300-mile trip from Hexham in time. 'As someone who travels regularly up & down the country from the North East to represent my constituents in Parliament (without ever using a private jet) that sounds like a very lame excuse to me - more like a PM avoiding scrutiny of the sleaze his Party & Government are mired in,' she tweeted. Environment Secretary George Eustice inflamed Tory fury yesterday by claiming on Sky News that the row over Mr Paterson was a 'storm in a teacup'. The minister's comments were branded 'unhelpful' and 'complete nonsense' in a sign of the anger on the Conservative Party benches. Tory former minister Tobias Ellwood also underlined how serious the row was, telling the BBC: 'We should not deny that this was a dark week for British democracy.' MPs could be banned from taking up positions as consultants outside their parliamentary duties after it emerged this week that Tory MP Owen Paterson had lobbied the government on behalf of two companies he worked for. Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is expected to put forward a proposal to review the House of Commons' standards procedures which may prevent MPs for offering consulting services to earn extra cash amid the parliamentary debate over the Paterson scandal. An investigation led by the standards commissioner Kathryn Stone said Paterson had broken Commons rules by lobbying for two firms that paid him £500,000, and he resigned from his position on Thursday after a botched plan concocted by the Prime Minister to block his suspension from Parliament buckled under a torrent of criticism. Despite his resignation, Paterson has vehemently denied any wrong-doing, saying he was acting in the public interest and protesting that the procedural route to the findings against him were against due process by not affording sufficient means of appeal. Dozens of MPs are being paid tens of thousands of pounds a year to act as consultants and advisers for a range of companies, with some receiving many times their yearly parliamentary salary of £81,932 according to the Register of Members' Financial Interests. There are no rules against MPs being paid for advising external businesses provided they record it in their register of interests, but they must not lobby the Government on behalf of those businesses. Sir Keir will push Mr Johnson to 'commit to a full, transparent investigation into the more than £600million of taxpayer money handed without competition or tender to Randox', one of the firms Mr Paterson worked for. A Downing Street source last night said a peerage was 'not on the cards' for Mr Paterson, after Mr Eustice earlier insisted it was 'highly unlikely'. And a close friend of Mr Paterson said a peerage had not been 'mentioned, offered or sought'. They insisted that he did not plan to apply for a Commons pass, even though he is eligible for one as a former MP. Sent out to bat for the government this morning, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said she thought Mr Johnson would merely watch the Commons debate on TV on while he worked in his office. She also appeared to signal a truce in the campaign against Ms Stone, insisting she will remain in the key post. Ms Trevelyan said she did not know for certain whether the PM would be there, but told Sky News: 'My opinion would be that no, he shouldn't be there, he will no doubt – as we all do – have the House of Commons on in his office as he's dealing with many, many other issues that only a Prime Minister that can deal with. 'He will get a briefing of the key issues raised by colleagues from across the House later on, I believe that the Leader and other ministers will be well placed to take the despatch box this afternoon.' Ms Trevelyan said she had 'no doubt' Ms Stone will stay in her job - despite fellow Cabinet minister Kwasi Kwarteng suggesting last week she would have to quit. She said Ms Stone was 'independently appointed', adding: 'She will continue to do her job and I'm (in) no doubt she will.' Ms Trevelyan suggested the issue of second jobs for MPs should be 'looked at again'. She said: 'I think the question of whether MPs having jobs that involve lobbying, I think, perhaps should be looked at again. 'Across the board, I don't think we should have a removal of the ability to maintain or have a second job because it brings a richness to our role as Members of Parliament as well as the work we do day to day with our constituents.' Ms Trevelyan said: 'Speaking as a woman who has also had terrible death threats, it is incredibly hard and we have to be very resilient these days, particularly as women in public life, and it is very hard and it is always unacceptable. She added: 'I hope that, obviously, Kathryn has the support that she needs through this but this is something that comes at many women, we've heard Angela Rayner has been under attack … whether or not how she speaks her mind is her own choice, but it is always unacceptable for there to be death threats. 'Following the tragic, ghastly death of my colleague David Amess just a few weeks ago, we continue to know that we have to be incredibly resilient as politicians and people in public life. 'This is not how we want our country to be and we need to all work forward to make sure that the commentary is considered and carefully done, and that we can all do our jobs across the piste in an environment of safety.' Meanwhile, the Commons standards committee has revealed it could conclude its own inquiry into the conduct rules and MPs' second jobs before Christmas - potentially recommending a ban on consultancy work. Chairman Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, claimed there had been an attempt to 'intimidate' Ms Stone and the government should have kept its 'grubby mitts' off the process. Mr Paterson stepped down as an MP last week after ministers were forced to abandon efforts to save him. Mr Johnson dropped a bid to prevent Mr Paterson being suspended from Parliament for lobbying on behalf of two firms which paid him more than £500,000. He resigned hours later, saying he wanted to leave behind the 'cruel world of politics'. It has emerged Mr Paterson, a former Cabinet minister, will be able to retain access to the Commons as he is entitled to apply for a so-called 'category X' pass for former parliamentarians. Some 283 ex-MPs possess the cards which give them continued entry, including to Parliament's restaurants and bars, without being required to register their financial interests as sitting MPs and peers must. But they are barred from lobbying under Commons rules. Current passholders include Sir Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary who is deputy chairman of an oil firm, Michael Dugher, a former Labour MP who is chief executive of the gambling industry body the Betting and Gaming Council, and Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who works at Facebook. The scale of the damage was underlined yesterday with an Opinium poll for the Observer putting the Tories on 37 per cent, down three points on last week The debacle over the Owen Paterson report was far from the first time Boris Johnson has clashed with Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone. And their relationship is unlikely to get easier, as he could face another probe by the watchdog into the 'Wallpapergate' controversy over refurbishment of his grace-and-favour flat - as well as his refusal to declare his recent 'freebie' Marbella holiday on the parliamentary register . Ms Stone has previously castigated the Prime Minister over a lavish £15,000 Caribbean holiday funded by Tory donors. But he was saved from punishment - which could have included being the first serving premier to be suspended from the Commons, by MPs who overturned her ruling. She has also pulled him up over an 'over-casual attitude' to declaring his own personal financial interests to Parliament, including a six-figure stake in an English country mansion. Mr Johnson was dramatically cleared in the summer of breaking Commons rules over a 'freebie' trip to the millionaire's playground of Mustique with Carrie - despite Ms Stone condemning his behaviour and the 'unusual' arrangements. The cross-party Standards Committee found the PM had made an 'accurate and complete' declaration about the holiday in December 2019, saying it was a donation from Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross even though the couple did not stay in his villa. The committee - chaired by Labour MP Chris Bryant - overruled Ms Stone after she concluded that Mr Johnson did breach the Code of Conduct for MPs during a 15-month wrangle after initially failing to provide a full explanation, slamming him for 'not showing the accountability required of those in public life'. The report also suggested that the premier himself did not know exactly how the jaunt was being funded until after he arrived on Mustique and realised he was not staying in Mr Ross's own property. Ms Stone has revealed she will consider whether to launch an investigation into Mr Johnson's conduct when Tory donors initially part-funded the lavish overhaul of his residence above No11 Downing Street. A decision will be made once the ongoing Electoral Commission probe is complete. Mr Johnson is also facing a backlash over refusing to declare his recent holiday to Lord Goldsmith's luxury villa near Marbella on the Commons register. The decision to use the ministerial register, which means he does not have to disclose the value of the gift, could be a further flashpoint with Ms Stone. One Commons source told MailOnline that as the villa is owned by the Goldsmith family it cannot be treated solely as a gift from Lord Goldsmith - which could torpedo No10's arguments against putting it on the MP register.

2021-11-08	12:28:09+00:00	Unknown	Phys.org - News And Articles On Science And Technology	Benin's groundbreaking new abortion law will save the lives of many women	https://phys.org/news/2021-11-benin-groundbreaking-abortion-law-women.html	" November 8, 2021 by Ramatou Ouedraogo, The Conversation Benin's parliament has voted to legalize abortion in most circumstances. This is a groundbreaking move by the west African country given that 92% of women of reproductive age on the continent live in countries which have restrictions—some moderate, some severe—on abortions. Moina Spooner, from The Conversation Africa, asked reproductive health expert, Ramatou Ouedraogo, to unpack the significance of this ruling. What does Benin's new abortion law say? Benin's new abortion law, which amends a previous one, now states that: ""upon the request of the pregnant woman, voluntary termination of pregnancy can be allowed when the pregnancy is likely to aggravate or cause a situation of material, educational, professional or moral distress incompatible with the interest of the woman and/or the unborn child…"" The voluntary termination of the pregnancy is not to happen after 12 weeks of amenorrhea, the absence of a period. Before this amendment, a woman could get her pregnancy terminated if the pregnancy would threaten her health or life, in case of fetal malformation, or when the pregnancy was a result of incest or rape. The new law expands this to protect a woman's education or career. In 2017, only six out of 53 African countries, permitted abortion at the woman's request during the first trimester of pregnancy. They were Cape Verde, South Africa, Tunisia, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Angola up to 10 weeks of gestation. Zambia, like Benin, includes socioeconomic reasons in its abortion laws. Benin's new law will provide more women with access to safe abortion in instances that they may not want, or be able, to continue with a pregnancy. For instance, a student who gets pregnant and fears dropping out of school as result, can request for her pregnancy to be terminated to give her chance to complete her studies. Previous studies have shown that continuation of studies is a common reason among girls and young women terminating pregnancy. The same applies to a woman who already has three or four children that she is struggling to feed, and feels her current financial and material conditions cannot accommodate another child. The new law opens the door for such women to access safe abortion, instead of resorting to unsafe methods and risking their lives. Why has this stance been taken in Benin? I will say that Benin took this stance mainly to protect and save the lives of women, and the long-term advocacy around this. As seen across the world, laws don't necessarily prevent women from seeking abortion services. Rather, they'll find a clandestine, and possibly deadly, alternative. This is especially the case for women who lack resources and are economically vulnerable. This is because women with more wealth, a higher education level and strong network are more likely to access safe abortion than those with less resources. Although there's not been a nationwide survey of abortion in the country—assessing the rate, cost and consequences of unsafe abortions—a few studies were able to show the burden and consequences of unsafe abortion in the country. The Ministry of Health estimates that 15% of maternal deaths in the country result from unsafe abortion. And data on complications associated with clandestine abortions and practices related to family planning use show that unsafe abortions are a growing trend. The ongoing ethnographic study that the African Population and Health Research Center (where I work) is conducting in Benin in collaboration with Rutgers as part of the ""She makes her safe choice program' concurs with such findings. It shows that women and girls are desperate, and so transgress the law. They risk death and stigma, to get rid of pregnancy that threatens their lives and livelihoods. For instance, casual laborers—such as domestic workers and sexworkers—reported that unwanted pregnancies could be be detrimental to their jobs. They would have to stop working, thereby having no means of subsistence for themselves, and the new child. Through our work we've seen how civil society organizations, health workers—such as gynecologists and midwives (who are often encounter women who seek medical attention after unsafe abortions go wrong) – and international and national NGOs such as the (Beninese Association for the Promotion of the Family) engaged in long-term, and sometimes quiet, advocacy. They used their experience to convince parliamentarians of the fact that pro-choice abortion laws will not encourage women to go for abortion. Rather, they will save the lives of those who will seek abortion regardless of the restrictions in place. How does this approach compare with other countries in the region? The Benin approach is somewhat groundbreaking in the Africa region. Benin goes beyond the Maputo Protocol, which has been the policy goal in the region for all the states, to: ""protect the reproductive rights of women by authorizing medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the fetus."" The Democratic Republic of Congo has been the most progressive country in the francophone region, as they gazetted the Maputo Protocol in 2018. Apart from that, all the countries are still in the advocacy process for enforcing at least the Maputo protocol. This development in Benin demonstrates that African policy makers are capable and willing to make laws that take into consideration women's reproductive health and rights. What will be the implications of this ruling? This is a progressive step with regards to a woman's reproductive health and rights. Making the decision to have an abortion has always been a hard decision for women. From my experience, women usually consider abortion as a last resort. It is a very difficult and emotional experience, which has been worsened by legal restrictions. The implication of this ruling is that it brings relief for women in their decision making process. It will provide access to safe medical pregnancy termination from public and private health facilities. By accessing I mean cost and availability. Clandestine procedures are known to be expensive. On the other hand the services will be moving from hidden to publicly available in health facilities. In some cases, access to safe abortion ensures that serious consequences of unsafe abortion are averted. However, it is important to note that the ruling of the law on its own is not enough for women to access the medical abortion services. There is a lot to do including developing policies for the implementation of the law, working with health professionals to reduce the number of those who are likely to refuse to offer such services using conscientious objection.

The PM said opposition parties wanted to focus on 'a particular case, a particular MP who suffered a serious personal tragedy, and who's now resigned'. He said: 'I don't think there's much more to be said about that particular case, I really don't, but what we do need to do is look also at the process, and that is what we were trying to do last week.' He said he hoped there would be 'cross-party agreement on a way forward, including an appeals process'. 'I have the utmost respect for the Speaker and his general desire to produce a cross-party outcome, cross-party reform of the system, which is what we were trying to achieve last week,' he said. No10 said the premier is travelling by train. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay will reprepsent the government instead. Reminded that Mr Johnson had flown back from the COP26 summit last week apparently in order to attend a social dinner, the spokesman said: 'I gave you the reason for that flight before.' He added: 'We think the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, whose department is the lead on this area, is the right person to lead (the debate).' Environment Secretary George Eustice inflamed Tory fury yesterday by claiming on Sky News that the row over Mr Paterson was a 'storm in a teacup'. The minister's comments were branded 'unhelpful' and 'complete nonsense' in a sign of the anger on the Conservative Party benches. Tory former minister Tobias Ellwood also underlined how serious the row was, telling the BBC: 'We should not deny that this was a dark week for British democracy.' Ahead of today's debate, Keir Starmer called on Mr Johnson to 'answer, apologise and act' over the scandal. And to confirm that Mr Paterson won't be given a peerage. He will push Mr Johnson to 'commit to a full, transparent investigation into the more than £600million of taxpayer money handed without competition or tender to Randox', one of the firms Mr Paterson worked for. A Downing Street source last night said a peerage was 'not on the cards' for Mr Paterson, after Mr Eustice earlier insisted it was 'highly unlikely'. And a close friend of Mr Paterson said a peerage had not been 'mentioned, offered or sought'. They insisted that he did not plan to apply for a Commons pass, even though he is eligible for one as a former MP. Sent out to bat for the government this morning, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said she thought Mr Johnson would merely watch the Commons debate on TV on while he worked in his office. She also appeared to signal a truce in the campaign against Ms Stone, insisting she will remain in the key post. Ms Trevelyan said she did not know for certain whether the PM would be there, but told Sky News: 'My opinion would be that no, he shouldn't be there, he will no doubt – as we all do – have the House of Commons on in his office as he's dealing with many, many other issues that only a Prime Minister that can deal with. 'He will get a briefing of the key issues raised by colleagues from across the House later on, I believe that the Leader and other ministers will be well placed to take the despatch box this afternoon.' Ms Trevelyan said she had 'no doubt' Ms Stone will stay in her job - despite fellow Cabinet minister Kwasi Kwarteng suggesting last week she would have to quit. She said Ms Stone was 'independently appointed', adding: 'She will continue to do her job and I'm (in) no doubt she will.' She said: 'The Speaker of the House, I think, will be making a statement about considering how to mend the way the committee works, that Kathryn runs. 'I think that's the conversation that we need to have, because colleagues have for some time felt that the way the committee works doesn't have all the relevant protections and safeguards that it should have. 'We will continue to do that and I hope that Kathryn's situation will be eased, and that those aggressive voices will be removed from her environment.' She added: 'I think Kathryn needs to be allowed to get on with her job.' Ms Trevelyan suggested the issue of second jobs for MPs should be 'looked at again'. She said: 'I think the question of whether MPs having jobs that involve lobbying, I think, perhaps should be looked at again. 'Across the board, I don't think we should have a removal of the ability to maintain or have a second job because it brings a richness to our role as Members of Parliament as well as the work we do day to day with our constituents.' Ms Trevelyan said: 'Speaking as a woman who has also had terrible death threats, it is incredibly hard and we have to be very resilient these days, particularly as women in public life, and it is very hard and it is always unacceptable. She added: 'I hope that, obviously, Kathryn has the support that she needs through this but this is something that comes at many women, we've heard Angela Rayner has been under attack … whether or not how she speaks her mind is her own choice, but it is always unacceptable for there to be death threats. 'Following the tragic, ghastly death of my colleague David Amess just a few weeks ago, we continue to know that we have to be incredibly resilient as politicians and people in public life. 'This is not how we want our country to be and we need to all work forward to make sure that the commentary is considered and carefully done, and that we can all do our jobs across the piste in an environment of safety.' Meanwhile, the Commons standards committee has revealed it could conclude its own inquiry into the conduct rules and MPs' second jobs before Christmas - potentially recommending a ban on consultancy work. Chairman Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, today claimed there had been an attempt to 'intimidate' Ms Stone and the government should have kept its 'grubby mitts' off the process. Mr Paterson stepped down as an MP last week after ministers were forced to abandon efforts to save him. Mr Johnson dropped a bid to prevent Mr Paterson being suspended from Parliament for lobbying on behalf of two firms which paid him more than £500,000. He resigned hours later, saying he wanted to leave behind the 'cruel world of politics'. It has emerged Mr Paterson, a former Cabinet minister, will be able to retain access to the Commons as he is entitled to apply for a so-called 'category X' pass for former parliamentarians. Some 283 ex-MPs possess the cards which give them continued entry, including to Parliament's restaurants and bars, without being required to register their financial interests as sitting MPs and peers must. But they are barred from lobbying under Commons rules. Current passholders include Sir Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary who is deputy chairman of an oil firm, Michael Dugher, a former Labour MP who is chief executive of the gambling industry body the Betting and Gaming Council, and Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who works at Facebook.

2021-11-08	07:46:50+00:00	Maciej Onoszko	Bloomberg | Latest And Live Business	Thousands of Poles Protest After Death Linked to Abortion Law	https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/thousands-of-poles-protest-after-death-linked-to-abortion-law	(Bloomberg) -- Thousands took to the streets in Poland on Saturday to protest the nation’s stringent abortion law and pay tribute to a woman who died after doctors refrained from ending her life-threatening pregnancy. The woman, who was carrying a 22-week fetus with congenital malformations, died of septic shock in September after doctors declined to end her pregnancy until the fetus died, according to lawyers representing her family. Last year’s ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, the country’s top court whose members are mainly ruling party appointees, said that abortions are unconstitutional even when the fetus can’t survive outside the womb. Passage of the law ended what had essentially been a near three-decade political truce on abortion, and fired up mass protests across the country. It’s unclear how and whether the latest protests, dubbed “Not One More,” will affect Poland’s political situation. The marches attracted leaders of the opposition, including former European Council President Donald Tusk and Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, as well as left-wing politicians. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Friday the circumstances of the woman’s death in south Poland must be investigated, adding the Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling hasn’t changed anything in terms of protecting pregnant women whose lives are in danger. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.
2021-11-07	23:16:31+00:00	Unknown	english	Poland's Health Ministry Clarifies Abortion Law After Woman's Death	http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/11/08/2021110800462.html	" November 08, 2021 08:16 Poland's Health Ministry issued instructions Sunday to doctors confirming that it is legal to terminate a pregnancy when the woman's health or life is in danger, a directive that comes amid apparent confusion over a new restriction to the country's abortion law. The document addressed to obstetricians comes in reaction to the hospital death of a 30-year-old mother whose pregnancy was in its 22nd week. The woman died in September but her death became widely known this month. Doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, in southern Poland, held off terminating her pregnancy despite the fact that her fetus lacked enough amniotic fluid to survive, her family and a lawyer say. The doctors have been suspended and prosecutors are investigating. Angered Poles held massive nationwide protests over the weekend, blaming the woman's death on Poland's restrictive abortion law. Women's rights activists say it has a chilling effect on doctors in this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. The ministry stressed it is in line with the law to terminate a pregnancy when the woman's health is in danger, even more so in case of threat to her life. It included guidance in case of premature loss of the amniotic fluid. ""It should be clearly stressed that doctors must not be afraid to take evident decisions. stemming from their experience and the available medical knowledge,"" the ministry said. Until a year ago, women in Poland could have abortions in three cases -- if the pregnancy resulted from a crime like rape, if the woman's health or life was at risk, or in the case of irreparable defects of the fetus. That last possibility was eliminated a year ago, when the Constitutional Tribunal ruled it went against Poland's law. "
2021-11-07	19:00:00+00:00	Unknown	srilankaguardian	Sri Lanka: End the monkey business now and get serious for once!	http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2021/11/sri-lanka-end-monkey-business-now-and.html	"by Rohana R. Wasala (The concluding second part of “Now is the time to prove your mettle, Mr President!” - November 6, 2021) My gut feeling is that the Presidential Task Force, if it is what I think it is, i.e., a brilliantly thought out ploy with an ulterior motive, is meant to abort the new constitution making project. It was probably designed to divide Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils, also create suspicion between the former and Christians, while pacifying radicalized Muslims. This will help … The PTF has been established, according to the gazette notification, “Focusing on the fact that administration of justice, its implementation and protection under the law should be fair by all as set out in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Whereas, it is indicated under fundamental rights therein that no citizen should be discriminated against in the eye of law on meted out special treatment on ground of nationality, religion, caste or any other grounds; And whereas, the implementation of the concept; one country, one law within Sri Lanka is reflected as a methodology of ensuring nationally and internationally recognized humanitarian values, And whereas, the fact that all citizens are treated alike in the eye of the law should be further ensure, ….”. This provides an idea of the brief that the PTF received. In implicit response to the mostly negative reception of the news of its establishment among the people, Ven. Gnanasara has repeatedly tried to rationalize the One Country One Law concept; but that is unnecessary for there is no quarrel about the cogent reasons that led to the call for the One Country One Law idea; the need for a single legal system has been correctly identified by the majority of the general public, with the negligible exception of a few religious extremists whose established religious traditions come into conflict with the country’s secular laws. The question is about the rationale of the establishment of the PTF. Through the extraordinary gazette notification the president authorizes the task force to “make such inquiries and issue such instructions as are required for the purpose of executing the tasks so entrusted”. The President appoints, as secretary to the PTF, his Senior Assistant Secretary Ms Jeevanthie Senanayake. He further requires and directs “all public officers and other persons to whom the said Task Force may issue instructions or from whom assistance for provision of services may be requested, to comply with all such instructions, render all such assistance and furnish all such information as may be properly complied with, rendered and furnished on that behalf”. The President demands that the PTF report to him “all instances where any Government employee or an officer in any ministry, government department, state corporation or any such institution who delay the performance of duties and fulfillment of responsibilities or fail to perform such duties and responsibilities to be entrusted by the said Task Force”. Surely, the President did not draft this legal document. President Gotabaya has been known for his spartan lifestyle and personal discipline acquired through his life in the military and his blemishless moral character as a person, and his strict disciplinarianism as a civil administrator. The last instruction to the PTF (to report to him instances, if any, of insubordination or non-cooperation) smacks of coercion and authoritarianism, for which no need should arise in this context. Why did the drafter include that sort of phraseology? It does not reflect favourably on the President. There is food for thought here. He directs the members to “submit reports to me at least once a month and submit the final report on or before 28th February, 2022”. Getting a Buddhist monk involved in governance matters (in the form of virtual nationalistic legal framing) is the last thing I would have expected from a president who the people hoped would bring about a systemic change in the mode of government. In Sri Lanka’s long history, the kings maintained a close relationship with the monks, only as religious advisers, not as partners in making laws or ruling. As a whistleblower, Ven. Gnanasara Thera exposed the existence of burgeoning religious extremism years ago, but his exposures did not get enough recognition by the authorities for some reason. Instead, he was unfairly condemned as an irresponsible rabble-rouser intent on troublemaking for some political advantage. Ven. Gnanasara is trying to provide the initiative that only politicians and the Mahanayakes could and should provide in resolving the single issue that has caused him to deviate from his religious vows and engage in the rough and tumble of mundane agitational activism . But he is not equipped to play that role in any way. His berserk behaviour finally landed him in jail for contempt of court. Had he been more disciplined in his protests, he wouldn’t have been thus treated, in spite of his intentions having been genuinely benign as well as patriotic. His personality defect has damaged not only his personal reputation and his cause, and his credibility as a defender of the Buddha Sasanaya, the people and the country. The Thera has been led astray by the cynical opportunism of politicians who exploit the sensitive perennial issue of the threat posed to the country’s age-old Buddha Sasanaya/the Buddhist religious-cultural establishment and to its historic archaeological heritage in the form of ruins scattered, particularly, in the north and east. The threat comes from the local representatives of forms of the religious fundamentalism that is sweeping across the whole world, especially by different sects of potentially violent Islamic/Íslamist extremists, sponsored by moneyed foreign agents. Treasure hunters cause probably more damage to this heritage. Behind the religious extremists seems to stand the Western imperialist juggernaut that uses religious fundamentalism and other forms of extremism to destabilise nation states that it wants to control to achieve varied geopolitical ends at the latter’s expense. What the monks are demanding is protection for the Buddhist establishment from this threat. Theirs is not a political struggle; they are not fighting for political ends. What they say is: Stop unfair proselytisation of poverty stricken Buddhists and Hindus who are equally subject to subversion by numerous foreign funded, politicized fundamentalist Christian and Islamic sects. The problem can be easily sorted out if the politicians have the political will to do so, and if the politicians in power at any time get the government servants working in the vulnerable areas to implement the available archaeological conservation and protection laws without abandoning their responsibilities for illicit monetary gains. The indifference and inaction of the traditional Mahanayakes (their culpable innocence and ignorance are inexcusable) form the other strong factor that betrays Buddhist interests. My criticism of the establishment of a Presidential Task Force for the implementation of the One Country One Law headed by a Buddhist monk does not mean a rejection of that important objective. It must be achieved during the presidency of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. For that, a proper strategy must be adopted. However, as the Bar Council of Sri Lanka, has pointed out, the PTF has no role to play in implementing the stated concept, because the functions assigned to it are already being performed by the available constitutionally established institutions including the Parliament and the Ministry of Justice (The Island/November 3); so, it is a redundant body. The only ‘benefit' that has accrued from the controversial move is that it has given the opportunistic minority politicians who hide behind extremists, without supporting them openly, extra ammunition for their blasts of criticism against the nationalist government. Meanwhile, in the first part of this article, I wrote that the other members of the PTF were, in my opinion, generally mediocre. For example, one academic I find mentioned as a member of the task force was the target of my criticism in an article entitled “Academic Adolescents against the Nationalist Cause” published in the Lankaweb online forum on May 1, 2020. This was concerning a paper about Buddhist Muslim clashes in Sri Lanka he had contributed to an international academic publication in 2016. In that paper, he had the following among his specious conclusions: Especially in light of the current upheaval in the international community regarding the Human Rights situation in Sri Lanka, it is imperative that the island strengthens its existing cordialities with friendly nations, most of whom are Muslim countries. If domestic conditions turn unfavorable to the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, it would be logical to assume that these countries would be less inclined than they are now to show their solidarity with the island nation… Buddhist-Muslim clashes in Sri Lanka, as this essay shows, are not a recent phenomenon. However, they did become more pronounced in the recent past with the renewed interest of BBS, among others, in the Muslim community and the [perceived] threat they pose to the Sinhala-Buddhist community. Since Buddhist monks comprise a very potent tool that shapes public opinion, it is extremely important that they deliberate on their views and stances before involving the public in certain issues because though their actions are fundamentally oriented towards the preservation of Buddhism and the Sinhalese, if their actions themselves serve to warrant international interference in Sri Lanka to probe the Human Rights condition of the country, the very entities that they strive to preserve will be the first to be compromised. Following was the concluding paragraph of my article mentioned above that was carried in the Lankaweb online journal on May 1, 2020 (Interested readers may look it up there: http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2020/05/01/academic-adolescents-against-the-nationalist-cause/): ""It is strange that this academic was not informed enough about the existing local realities (not exclusively those uncovered with evidence by the BBS - Bodu Bala Sena) relating to the problem of the menace posed to Sri Lankans of all races and religions and worldviews, especially to Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus who together form over 80% of the population, from Abrahamic religious fundamentalists (not from the mainstream adherents of those religions), when he wrote to that international journal. These monks do ‘deliberate on their views and stances before involving the public…’; there is nothing wrong with their actions, but whatever can they do if they are misreported to the world by indifferent media, and immature ill-informed academics?” Incidentally, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), created by Basil Rajapaksa and led by Mahinda Rajapaksa (the current Finance Minister, and Prime Minister, respectively) held its 5th National Convention at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre, Colombo on November 2, 2021. Minister Basil Rajapaksa emphasized the importance of MR’s leadership. President Gotabaya congratulated the party, in a message, on its great success within a short time of its inauguration, reflected in its winning of a near two thirds of parliamentary seats (in August 2020). PM Mahinda Rajapaksa said, among other things, that the teacher strike and the farmer agitations would not have dragged on so long if they had maintained more political engagement with them (Did he mean showering cajolery on them? Or more patting on the back?). He also made special mention of the young people who voluntarily beautified towns and cities across the country with beautiful wall paintings (when the new government came into being in 2019 with the election of the current president, whose advent generated in them the new spirit of hope that inspired them to engage in that voluntary exercise without any expectation of a reward); those youths, the PM remembered, by doing that, indicated their wish that politicians should not spoil the street walls with their ugly political posters. Where are those young people now? He asked, and provided his own answer: “If they have joined the queue of passport applicants (who want to acquire a passport with the intention of leaving the country looking for greener pastures abroad), we should engage in the kind of politics that will encourage them to return”. If the PM is genuine about what he is saying here, we may expect him to stop monkeying around with monks and to change his attitude towards patriotic young politicians of all parties and communities vis a vis his own son. The PM must have meant what he said. If he really does, he will not relapse into the the 73 year long monkey business of taking the monks for rides or flights. It is disgraceful how political monks are conducting themselves at this critical time, especially that sneaky Ratana Thera, who stole the national list MP post from Gnanasara Thera, who actually earned it for their party, is causing embarrassment to Gotabaya and the government through his hasty implementation (for expected personal political reputation) of the organic fertilizer initiative. Ven. Gnanasara said, to his credit, talking about the PTF, that in the future the youth of the country must come forward to save the nation. The country is not short of of young men and women who are capable of providing a sound modern leadership to the country if only their way is not obstructed by ambitious oldies whose ‘Vaulting ambition, which overleaps itself, And falls on th’other... ‘ (i.e., excess of ambition lands them somewhere else than where they want to reach, lands them in trouble, as happened to Macbeth in the Shakespeare play). It should be hoped that this occasion (the 5th anniversary of the SLPP) be utilised as an opportune moment to reflect on past errors, and resolve not to repeat them, and introduce a course correction, starting with rethinking a new approach to the implementation of the One Country One Law idea, that ensures the participation of all Sri Lankans, especially the young from all the communities, something that can be done through the existing agencies. My gut feeling is that the Presidential Task Force, if it is what I think it is, i.e., a brilliantly thought out ploy with an ulterior motive, is meant to abort the new constitution making project. (I have no idea of whose brainchild this could be.) It was probably designed to divide Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils, also create suspicion between the former and Christians, while pacifying radicalized Muslims for some unspecified reason. This might help revive the defeated separatist project, and breathe new life into secretly growing Islamism, and together help foreign designs on Sri Lanka, provoked purely by big power geopolitics due to its strategically important location in the Indo-Pacific region. Pitting guilless Islamist critic Gnanasara Thera against an Ulama Council maulavi by putting them in the same panel of advisors is like putting a dove and a cat in the same cage; for when it comes to religion, a believing Muslim will not compromise their religious principles to accommodate human reason. The government’s failure to achieve its key objective of introducing a new constitution will delight the still operative forces which were behind the 2015 regime change (they may even have acquired new allies by now). It is good to remember that Mahinda Rajapaksa was betrayed by his lieutenant three times in a row between 2015 and 2019, which does not reflect well on his sense of judgement; it could be a different traitor this time. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is probably the most ethically and morally honest person ever to hold that post. The frustrated regime changers are now propagating the faint fictitious notion that he benefited from the April 2019 Easter Sunday Islamist bombings and that the intelligence services that had reached the highest professional efficiency levels under him as Defence Secretary during MR’s time had some connection with them. The charge that the government is deliberately slow in meting out justice to those responsible for the Easter bombings is, I think, 100% false. All peace- and justice-loving Sri Lankans including me want to see the Easter attacks perpetrators receive condign punishment at the earliest possible; the highest involved (be it president Maithripala Sirisena, prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, during whose watch the suicide bomb attacks happened or any other individuals accountable) shouldn’t be spared. I, for one, believe that President Gotabaya, PM Mahinda, and others in the government will be satisfied with no less. However, even the Cardinal seems to have accepted that false allegation, in spite of repeated assurances given him by the President to the contrary. Two reasons for the Cardinal’s misgivings that occur to me are: potentially guilty former president Sirisena seems to be looking for refuge under his erstwhile boss that he betrayed three times, now PM; the other reason could be Gnanasara Thera’s arrogant, totally frivolous and uncalled for remarks about the Cardinal’s activism regarding the Muturajawela environmental issue. Gnanasara Thera was reported as having said about the Cardinal in this connection: “I warn the Cardinal that he should not overstep his boundaries!” That alone should have disqualified the monk for the post that he has been appointed. I personally believe that the President, as a practising Buddhist, can receive much more constructive advice from the Cardinal than from Gnanasara Thera. Finally, when the disciplined voters of the country (unfortunately, they don’t have enough disciplined politicians to serve them) voted for a new president and a new parliament about two years ago, they never expected a yahapalanaya type of government to come to power again, whatever happens later. Apparently, the country hasn’t still emerged from its evil legacy. Gotabaya Rajapaksa started off with the purest intentions. Buddhists believe in the truth of the saying: “dhammo have rakkhati dhammacari” the dhamma protects the faithful follower of the dhamma”. He need not fear. But whatever he is intent on doing, he should first win the agreement and support of the common people before trying it. Anyone with an average familiarity with the recent political history of the world know that patriotic leaders of independent countries who don’t serve the interests of more powerful nations at the expense of the welfare and wellbeing of their own people are not safe. Their safety depends on the people’s goodwill, provided democracy is allowed to rule. But as we know today, countries find themselves ruled from outside. That is an unpleasant reality, we can hardly overcome. In Sri Lanka, the two traditional parties or alliances have two different attitudes to this predicament. One favours it, the other opposes it. These are respectively the UNP/SJB and the SLFP/SLPP. The second, the nationalistic party/alliance, has a problem managing foreign interference, with which the UNP/SJB seem comfortable with. Nationalists support forces that protect the country’s democracy, independence, and sovereignty. Gotabaya is a nationalist leader. Nationalists need not be demoralised when they are falsely attacked as ethno-nationalist extremists by NGO mercenaries. If Gotabaya Rajapaksa is able to bring in a new constitution as a non-party product that is fashioned according to the common consensus of all parliamentarians (including essentially all young ones, that is, those under 40, for example) who do not have to vote for it under duress, let that be the greatest achievement he will be remembered for. Such a constitution should be one that does not divide the nation on language, religion, or race bases. It will eliminate the influence of extremists, and definitely incorporate the One Country One Law principle. Giving anything a special place or special protection, as experience shows, invariably turns out to be counter-productive. So, this has to be avoided. This is a controversial proposition, which should receive public attention. It will be achievable, if the gerontocrats ruling the roost today make way for the brilliant youth of the country to take centre stage in the political arena."

They managed to bang out Aaron Rodgers being anti-vaxx, Glenn Youngkin nabbing Virginia, and a bold new Trump impersonator in the cold open alone. Later they dunked on Ice Cube for also not getting vaccinated. And oh right, there’s also that draconian abortion law that was recently enacted in Texas. It’s not the funniest subject, but Cecily Strong made a valiant attempt to find the humor in the grim topic. Strong swung by Weekend Update dressed as “Goober the Clown,” whose bona fides are that she had an abortion when she was 23. She refuses to let that nor the unpleasant subject matter get her down. Indeed, she stays in clown mode for the duration of her monologue. “I really don’t [want to talk about this],” Strong’s Goober said. “But people keep bringing it up, so I gotta talk about freaking abortion… I wish I didn’t have to do this, because the abortion I had at 23 is my personal clown business.” Throughout, Goober struggles to make the subject of states infringing on women’s rights fun and funny. “It’s a rough subject,” she said, “so we’re gonna do fun clown stuff to make it more palatable. Who wants a balloon animal?” She also kept referring to it exclusively as “clown abortion,” to co-anchor Colin Jost’s bafflement. “Did you know that one in three clowns will have an abortion in her lifetime?” Strong asked. “You don’t, because they don’t tell you. They don’t even know how to talk to other clowns about it, because when they do talk about it, if you were a clown who wasn’t the victim of something sad like clown-cest, they think your clown abortion wasn’t a ‘righteous clown abortion.’ I mean, what the d*ck is that?!” Eventually she told the story of the abortion she had when she was young, but only after inhaling some funny voice-making helium. If Goober didn’t succeed in mining laughs from the a-word, then at least Strong did. You can watch the sketch in the video above.

And Bravo, Woman’	https://www.thewrap.com/cecily-strong-snl-abortion-segment-wins-praise/	"”This is wonderful, joyful, and powerful,“ activist Renee Bracey Sherman writes Cecily Strong got very real with viewers during a Weekend Update segment “Saturday Night Live” this week, bringing light to what women go through when it comes to having an abortion – and she did all of that while dressed as a clown. Her candor left fans cheering. During the segment, Strong appeared as Goober the clown, who had an abortion when she was 23. Goober said she didn't actually want to talk about her abortion but felt like she needed to. As she went on, it became increasingly clear that Strong was basically being autobiographical, telling Jost that this was ""her truth."" “I know I wouldn’t be a clown on TV here today if it weren’t for the abortion I had the day before my 23rd birthday,” she shared. “Clowns have been helping each other end their pregnancies since the caves. It’s going to happen so it ought to be safe, legal and accessible. Not back to the alley. The last thing anyone wants is a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley.” With that, fans applauded Strong's bravery, along with her directness. ""WOW. I think Cecily Strong just made one of the most bravely personal admissions and appeals ever, couched as a clown gag on @nbcsnl SNL's Weekend Update,"" one person tweeted. ""Holy s---. And bravo, woman."" Renee Bracey Sherman, a long-time reproductive rights activist, also showed Strong some love on Twitter, keying in on her note that talking about the matter can be hard. ""This is wonderful, joyful, and powerful,"" Sherman wrote. ""For some people, sharing our abortion stories isn’t the easiest thing—especially over and over and over again. I appreciate the humor and truth that she conveys about her abortion story and journey. Thank you Cecily Strong.""

That was an argument worthy of scaring Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who seemed to take to heart the amicus brief from the Firearms Policy Coalition, which argued that ""it takes little in the way of creative copying for States hostile to the Second Amendment—New York, California, New Jersey, Hawaii, etc.—to declare that the ownership or sale of a handgun is illegal … and set up a bounty system with the same unbalanced procedures and penalties adopted by Texas in this case."" Speaking of guns, the court also heard a challenge to New York state's 108-year-old concealed handgun permit law, which requires that applicants show ""proper cause"" before getting an unrestricted license to carry. It's looking like that law will go down, or at least be narrowed. Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to sum up much of the conservative majority's view when he asked during oral arguments: ""You don't have to say, when you're looking for a permit to speak on a street corner or whatever, that your speech is particularly important. So why do you have to show in this case, convince somebody, that you're entitled to exercise your Second Amendment right?"" National polling continues to reflect support for sensible gun regulations, and abortion access and - overwhelmingly rejects Texas-style bans. Large majorities, too. Yet we've got a Supreme Court majority on the far-right fringe of mainstream America. There's increasing momentum to change that, though. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU)—one of North America's largest labor unions—announced its support for expanding the court in comments to the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States, urging that panel to restore the court's legitimacy. Writing for the group, International President Mary Kay Henry represents the ""union of approximately two million working women and men."" That's two million workers who ""stand in the unique position of being the targets of a long-running, coordinated, and well-funded effort to strip them of their organizing and other rights via federal-court litigation."" What's more, Henry writes, ""many SEIU members, as BIPOC citizens, are also targets of an additional campaign to strip them of their voting rights. That anti-voter campaign, like the anti-worker effort, has found success with this Supreme Court."" ""We firmly believe that this democracy rests on a razor's edge and came, within the last 12 months, very close to falling apart,"" Henry tells the commission, in large part because the ""interests of poor and working people have been largely shut out from government and the law, feeding the rise of anti-democratic forces to which people throughout history have turned in desperation."" Henry pleads with the commission to ""not forget where we have been in the last twelve months"" and to ""not get lost in all the academic talk and mundaneness of Zoom meeting rooms."" Henry makes a powerful argument for substantive reform, for the commission to not do the thing most presidential commissions do: ""Please be wary of meaningless gestures at reform and of resistance to change that is camouflaged as seemingly reasonable restraint, and please interrogate what may be even your own inherent biases against change."" Such gestures include a reform the commission seems to be considering, instituting term limits, which is nibbling around the edges of a 6-3 majority that is intent on rolling back decades of progress. Spending valuable time and political capital on such a limited effort, that could ultimately be rejected by that extremist majority anyway, puts that idea ""in the category of apparent reforms that may achieve nothing."" ""We believe it is long past time to expand the size of the Court,"" Henry writes on behalf of the SEIU. ""You have an opportunity to lend your credibility to serious suggestions that can lead to real change. Please do not waste it."" As of now, wasting this opportunity appears that's what the commission is inclined to do, scheduled to finish its work with a final report on December 15. The commission should recognize within itself what Henry warns it against, that its members are ""blessed by power, prestige, and expensive educations, […] very good at cloaking their arguments in what sound like high-minded principles."" Meanwhile, the effort to build a coalition in Congress to do the job the commission doesn't seem to want to take on continues and strengthens. There are now 40 House members cosponsoring the Judiciary Act of 2021 to expand the court."
2021-11-07	13:24:57+00:00	Posted byatomtabloid	njtoday	Texas law renews fight over abortion	https://njtodaynet.wordpress.com/2021/11/07/texas-law-renews-fight-over-abortion/	Texas’ abortion law has landed in the nation’s capital last week, as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether limitations on a woman’s ability to terminate her pregnancy are legal. Lawmakers heard from experts Thursday who urged the high court to strike it down. The highly controversial new abortion law in Texas restricts abortions after six weeks of gestation. The 1973 opinion in Roe v. Wade ruling put severe restrictions on the authority of any state to regulate abortion. If Texas wins in the Supreme Court, the ruling would overturn the precedent established by Roe v. Wade. A ruling for Texas would not outlaw abortion, but it would eradicate recognition of the implied right to privacy and leave questions whether a woman can terminate a pregnancy to the states. Abortion is safe and legal in all 50 states, but different states have different laws about when you can get an abortion there. Without the ruling in Roe v. Wade, a handful of Bible Belt states would restrict abortion to varying degrees. Former Justice Louis Brandeis, appointed by then-Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, called this system “the laboratory of states.” The arguments were not focused on abortion itself — the justices had actually declined Texas’ request to reconsider Roe v. Wade in that case — but on the unique enforcement mechanism that Texas had chosen: prohibiting state officials from enforcing the law while allowing any private citizen to sue an abortion doctor or person who “aids or abets” an abortion patient. In the next month, the court will likely issue a ruling on two questions about Texas’ end-run around America’s constitutional right to abortion. The Justice Department, which had never previously challenged an abortion restriction, will learn whether it can bring suits of this kind. Abortion providers questioning the Texas bill will see if they can sue — or if states can use S.B. 8 as a blueprint for nullifying other constitutional rights. Oral arguments this week certainly didn’t sound good for Texas, with several conservative justices, including Brett Kavanaugh, sounding skeptical. This could amount to something of a pyrrhic victory for abortion-rights advocates, however. The court’s conservative majority may not like it when conservative states try to nullify abortion rights, but that doesn’t mean the conservative justices aren’t ready to take down Roe themselves. And they have a much better case coming up to do just that. The questions being asked of the Texas bill may seem technical, but they have big implications: When can states pass unconstitutional laws and then stop the federal courts from doing anything about it? The answer will likely turn mostly on what the court makes of a case from the early 20th century called Ex Parte Young. There are limits on when someone can directly sue a state in federal court. Ex Parte Young carved out an exception: Individuals could get an injunction against state officials enforcing potentially unconstitutional laws. Texas claims to have a workaround to Ex Parte Young: Because it prohibited officials from enforcing the law, Texas is claiming no one can sue to stop them. A majority of the justices seemed worried about Texas’ nullification argument. But they also seemed concerned about the long-term consequences of siding with the Justice Department. Even Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to block S.B. 8 from going into effect, asked U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if there were any limits to the power to challenge unconstitutional laws. Even so, at most, Texas seemed to have three justices — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito — clearly on its side in both cases. All three justices dropped hints about what they thought of abortion rights, too. Gorsuch suggested providers were unfairly requesting “special treatment” for abortion rights. Alito asked a question about whether S.B. 8 would give women victimized by abortion a day in court.

Not only about her (either Goober or Strong’s) abortion experience, but about how conservatives’ constant woman-shaming has stifled meaningful conversation about the procedure even among Strong (or Goober’s) close circle of friends. Noting that one in three American women have an abortion in their lifetime, Strong/Goober yet lamented how it takes going out on a limb for any woman to try and speak about the issue with her peers. “And then, like, eight other clowns at the table say they’ve had an abortion, too, ’cause that’s how common it is,” Goober related, adding that, after that, “Everyone’s excited and relieved to be talking about it.” Cue bicycle horn, since Goober’s just a silly clown! You know, even when noting that, if she hadn’t had her abortion at 23, “I know I wouldn’t be a clown on TV today,” and that the only thing criminalizing abortion will do is ensure “a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley.” For Strong, the Goober’s manic routine served to mask her own barely contained anger at not only Texas’ patently unconstitutional law (which bans abortions even before women can know they’re pregnant) but also the successful stigmatization of a legal medical procedure that’s nobody’s goddamned business but the woman involved. (“What the dick is that?,” Strong asked of the Texas law, with Jost sheepishly reminding her about what you can’t say on live TV.) “It’s gonna happen, so it ought to be safe, legal, and accessible,” Strong/Goober concluded, her point emerging in the high, squeaky voice of someone who’s just sucked down a balloon’s-worth of helium in order to ease viewers into the unnecessarily stigmatized discussion.

This time, she was Goober, the clown who had an abortion when she was 23 — and she used the cover of being dressed like a clown to get extremely real about a woman’s right to choose. To be clear though, Goober didn’t really want to talk about the fact that she had an abortion the day before her 23rd birthday. “Well actually, I really don’t. But people keep bringing it up,” she explained to Colin Jost. “So I gotta keep talking about freakin’ abortion. It’s a rough subject, so we’re going to do fun clown stuff to make it more palatable.” Indeed, Goober had fun clown stuff, including a bright red nose and a spinning bow tie. But don’t let the whimsy fool you, this segment was a very real moment for Strong herself. “I wish I didn’t have to do this, because my abortion is my personal clown business,” she explains. “But that’s all people in this country want to discuss, all the time. Even though clown abortion was legalized in Clown v Wade in 1973.” Goober then recited stat that unfortunately, most women — or people in general — don’t know: that 1 in 3 women will go through it. “They don’t even know how to talk to other clowns about it,” she adds. “Because when they do talk about it, if you were a clown who wasn’t a victim of something sad, like clown-cest, they think your clown abortion wasn’t a righteous clown abortion. I mean, what the dink is that?” Goober — at this point we have to assume Cecily is basically being autobiographical — then described her experience having her abortion. First the doctor told a disarming joke that made her feel better: “The doctor asked if I got pregnant on the way over to the clinic, because I wasn’t very far along,” Goober said. “That’s one of my favorite jokes to this day. I love that joke. Such a good joke. Not like a funny ha-ha joke. But like a funny ‘you’re not an awful person and your life isn’t over’ joke. The best kind.” Also, Goober continued, the clinic had a guest book, “where all the clowns could write their clown abortion story for the next clown to read it, so she wouldn’t feel so alone.” Then she circled back to the fact that women feel they can’t talk about abortions, until someone takes a chance. “And then years later, you’d be at dinner with a big group of clowns. One clown will go out on a limb and say she’s had an abortion,” Goober says. “And then 8 other clowns at the table will say they’ve had an abortion too, because that’s how common it is. And everyone’s excited and relieved to be talking about it. Then it’s like ‘wow, we kept the secret so long despite being so grateful it happened. Honka honka.” Though Strong sucked helium out of a balloon to say her final piece, the weight of it wasn’t lost at all. “Colin, here is my truth: I know I wouldn’t be a clown on TV here today if it weren’t for the abortion I had the day before my 23rd birthday,” she admitted. “Clowns have been helping each other end their pregnancies since the caves. It’s going to happen so it ought to be safe, legal and accessible. Not back to the alley. The last thing anyone wants is a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley.” You can watch the segment in the video here and above.

2021-11-06	19:08:35+00:00	Cde	di-ve	‘The mother’s heart was beating too’ – Poles protest against strict abortion law	https://cde.news/the-mothers-heart-was-beating-too-poles-protest-against-strict-abortion-law/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-mothers-heart-was-beating-too-poles-protest-against-strict-abortion-law	WARSAW (Reuters) – Thousands of people gathered in cities across Poland on Saturday to protest against strict abortion laws after a pregnant woman’s death reignited public debate on the issue in one of Europe’s most devoutly Catholic countries. A ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal that abortion on the grounds of foetal defects contravened the constitution came into effect in January, triggering a near total ban on pregnancy terminations and widespread protests. People holding candles and carrying banners saying ‘not one more’ and ‘indifference is complicity’, marched through dozens of towns and cities on Saturday, according to organisers, including Pszczyna, southern Poland, where the woman lived. Activists say the death of Izabela, a 30-year-old woman in the 22nd week of pregnancy whose family said died of septic shock, was a result of the ruling. Izabela went to hospital in Pszczyna in September after her waters broke, her family said. Scans had previously shown numerous defects in the foetus. But doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy while the foetus still had a heartbeat. When a scan showed the foetus was dead, doctors decided to perform a Caesarean. The family’s lawyer, Jolanta Budzowska, said Izabela’s heart stopped on the way to the operating theatre and she died despite efforts to resuscitate her. ‘Her heart was beating too’ read slogans on banners and in information shared by protest organisers. “…the anti-abortion law in Poland kills Polish women. It is cruel, it is terrifying,” a woman attending a protest in Pszczyna said in a comment aired by a private broadcaster TVN24. “It is inhuman and I hope that this situation will contribute in some way, so that Polish women will not have to die,” she added. On Saturday, the news website Onet.pl published an interview with a husband of another woman who he claimed died in June in similar circumstances. The government says the court ruling was not to blame for Izabela’s death, rather an error by doctors. Poland’s health minister Adam Niedzielski pledged to issue guidelines to make it clear when terminations were legal. “I asked the National Consultant for Gynecology and Obstetrics to issue such guidelines…that will be unambiguous about the fact that the safety of a woman, in such a case as happened, is a reason to terminate the pregnancy,” he told private radio RMF FM. Poland’s president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the foetus was not viable. In September a draft bill introducing a total ban on abortion was submitted to parliament by a group of citizens. “…let’s finally change the law that kills women, deprives families of mothers, wives and sisters,” Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bak, a left-wing lawmaker, was quoted as saying ahead of protests by news agency PAP. Photo People take part in a protest under the slogan ‘Not one more’ in Warsaw, Poland, 06 November 2011. Protests against the new abortion law, which banned terminations in cases of foetal defects, sparked all over the country under the slogan ‘Not one more’, after the death of septic shock of a 30-year-old pregnant woman from Pszczyna.

We've received your submission. November 6, 2021 | 10:27am Alyssa Milano used to believe that the miscarriages she suffered were “karmic punishment” for the abortions she had in her 20s. “I definitely had this moment of, ‘Well, I’m being punished, basically, for abortions in my 20s,'” the actress, 48, told the “Me Becoming Mom” podcast on Thursday. Milano added that therapy helped her overcome those feelings later in life. “I didn’t realize that at the time,” she said. “It took a while in therapy to realize that that was something that I was putting on myself.” Unfortunately, prior to seeking therapy, the fear of punishment spilled over into the early years of motherhood for Milano, who now has two children: Milo Thomas, 10, and Elizabella Dylan, 7. “The way I interacted or was with my children — and I think this is common — but I always felt like, ‘What if something happens to these two little beings that I love so much?,'” she explained. “‘And is there a world in which they’re taken away from me for whatever karmic resolution needed to happen?'” The “Charmed” actress has previously opened up about having two abortions in 1993 during an episode of her own podcast, “Sorry Not Sorry,” in 2019. “I was not equipped to be a mother,” the #MeToo activist explained at the time, adding that she had the two abortions after getting pregnant while in a relationship and taking birth control pills. “It was devastating,” she said. “I was raised Catholic and was suddenly put in conflict with my faith. A faith I was coming to realize empowered only men to make every single decision about what was allowed and what was not allowed. I had a career and a future and potential. And also, I suffered from sometimes crippling anxiety.” Milano is now a pro-choice activist who appeared as a speaker during the Women’s March: Reproductive Rights in Los Angeles on Oct. 2.

2021-11-05	19:07:37+00:00	Kim Novak	Metro	Alyssa Milano thought miscarriage was ‘karma’ for having abortions as it was in ‘conflict’ with her faith	https://metro.co.uk/2021/11/05/alyssa-milano-thought-miscarriage-was-karma-for-having-abortions-15552715/	Alyssa Milano has opened up about her complicated thoughts on her past miscarriages, feeling like they were ‘karma’ for her having terminated pregnancies in the past. The actress and author, 48, who now has a son and a daughter, felt like she was being ‘punished’ with the miscarriages for having had abortions before she was ready to be a mother. She told People’s Me Becoming Mom podcast: ‘I definitely had this moment of, “Well, I’m being punished, basically, for abortions in my 20s.” ‘I didn’t realise that at the time. It took a while in therapy to realise that that was something that I was putting on myself.’ Alyssa shares 10-year-old son Milo and seven-year-old daughter Elizabella with husband David Bugliari and admits she worried that something would happen to them, adding: ‘I always felt like, “What if something happens to these two little beings that I love so much? And is there a world in which they’re taken away from me for whatever karmic resolution needed to happen?”’ She revealed that both of her miscarriages had happened early in the pregnancy, at around seven or eight weeks. Alyssa had revealed in 2019 that she had had two abortions within months of one another in 1993 when she was in her twenties. She explained on her Alyssa Milano: Sorry Not Sorry podcast: ‘I knew at that time, I was not equipped to be a mother, and so I chose to have an abortion. ‘I chose. It was my choice. And it was absolutely the right choice for me. It was not an easy choice. It was not something I wanted, but it was something that I needed, like most health care is. ‘It was devastating. I was raised Catholic and was suddenly put in conflict with my faith. A faith I was coming to realise empowered only men to make every single decision about what was allowed and what was not allowed.’ Alyssa added that she did not regret the decision, difficult as it was, as it made her the mother she is today. She added: ‘I would not have my children — my beautiful, perfect, loving, kind and inquisitive children who have a mother who was so very, very ready for them. ‘I would not have my career. I would not have the ability or platform I use to fight against oppression with all my heart. I would never have met my amazing husband David, whose steadfast and immeasurable love for me sustains me through these terrifying times.’ Got a story?

2021-11-05	18:31:59+00:00	Josh Marcus, Oliver O'Connell	The Independent	Aaron Rodgers invokes abortion, MLK Jr and thanks Joe Rogan in rant over why he’s not vaccinated	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/aaron-rodgers-joe-rogan-unvaccinated-b1952518.html	"Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers railed against “cancel culture” and the “woke mob,” as part of a rant during a radio appearance on Friday, after news that the reigning league MVP had tested positive for Covid earlier this week and wasn’t vaccinated, despite previously saying he had been “immunised”. “I realise I’m in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now, so before the final nail gets put in my cancel culture casket, I’d like to set the record straight on some of the blatant lies that are out there about me now,” Rodgers said on Friday during an appearance on the Pat McAfee show. Rodgers, whose positive Covid test means he’ll sit out the Packers’s Sunday game against the Kansas City Chiefs, said he avoided getting the vaccines not because he’s a “anti-vax flat earther,” but rather a “critical thinker.” After conducting his own research, the quarterback said he became concerned about the side effects of the vaccine and an allergy to the ingredients in the Moderna and Pfizer Covid treatments, so he underwent an unnamed alternative treatment at home with “medical professionals”. Defending his decision, Rodgers invoked the famous abortion slogan “my body, my choice,” as well as the words of civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. ""The great MLK said, ‘You have a moral obligation to object to unjust rules and rules that make no sense,’” Rodgers said, paraphrasing Dr King. The NFL star also said he’d spoken with alternative podcast host Joe Rogan for advice and has taken both monoclonal antibodies and ivermectin, a treatment for parasitic worms, headlice, and skin conditions such as rosacea, that is not approved for use against Covid-19. Rodgers went on to bizarrely claim that the left was anti-vaccine during the Trump presidency, but then flipped after Joe Biden’s election. “I’m a non-vaxxed person, so the right is gonna champion me, and the left is gonna cancel me, but the whole time, I don’t give a s*** about either of them ... the only desire I have is to empower people out there to take autonomy over their body,” he said. “Why do people hate Ivermectin? Not just because Trump championed it, but because it’s a cheap generic, and you can’t make any money off of it,” Rodgers said. He also claimed that there being a pandemic of the unvaccinated is “just a total lie”, despite all the case data supporting it and massive differences in hospitalisation and death rates. “If the vaccine is so great, then how come people are still getting Covid and spreading Covid?” he said, returning to the point later, saying that is how he believes he contracted the virus, also saying he is masked except when around all-vaccinated people. Rodgers said he felt his first symptoms on Tuesday night and then tested positive on Wednesday, adding that he “didn’t feel great yesterday, but I’m feeling really good today, Friday”. He later said: “I feel really good, and if this were the flu, there’s no reason I wouldn’t play on Sunday.” On the aftermath of his current illness, he said: “There’s a lot to natural immunity, and natural immunity has not been part of the conversation”, adding: “If you’ve gotten Covid, and recovered from it, that’s the best boost to immunity that we can have.” Studies have shown that immunity from Covid does persist for several months after recovery, but it is unclear for how long. The advice from health officials is still to get vaccinated to ensure longer-term immunity and protection against variants of the virus. Rodgers was asked on 26 August if he was vaccinated, and responded by telling reporters that he had been “immunised”. On 3 November when news broke of his positive test for Covid-19, Matt LaFleur, head coach of the Packers when asked about Rodgers said he would not comment on the vaccination status of any of the players or coaches. When asked if Rodgers saying he was “immunised” was misleading to fans, Mr LaFleur replied: “That’s a great question for Aaron. I’m not gonna comment on it.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers is reportedly sick with Covid after refusing to be vaccinated.

2021-11-05	15:56:30+00:00	Unknown	Vice News	Everything You Need To Know About Abortion Laws In the US	https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pkpy79/abortion-laws-in-us-everything-to-know	After a decade-long, coordinated attack on abortion rights, abortion opponents have never been closer to their ultimate dream: overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized the procedure nationwide. Without Roe, the ability to regulate abortion will return to the states and abortion rights would likely be protected in less than half of them. To understand how the United States got to this point, you have to turn the clock back to 2010, when Republicans, energized by President Barack Obama’s 2008 election, launched a massively successful effort to win seats in state legislatures. Their victory had dire consequences for abortion rights and access: Of the thousand-plus state-level abortion restrictions enacted since Roe’s passage, nearly half came into being in the last decade. And although anti-abortion activists spent the first half of the 2010s pursuing incremental laws that aimed to chip away at Roe, the push for outright abortion bans hit a fever pitch during the latter half of the Trump administration—and only sped up once President Joe Biden took office. Since Ohio introduced the first six-week abortion ban back in 2011, nine of the nation’s reddest states have passed their own version of the restrictive bill. These “heartbeat bills,” as anti-abortion activists call them, outlaw abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy based on the notion that cardiac activity can be detected that early. (At that point in pregnancy, an embryo does not have a fully developed heart.) Since many people women don’t know that they’re pregnant within those first six weeks, these bans essentially function as total bans on abortions—especially because these bills frequently lack exceptions for rape or incest. Until now, court challenges have put these six-week bans on ice, but that’s part of anti-abortion activists’ plan. Each outright abortion ban is designed to hand the conservative-leaning Supreme Court a chance to overturn Roe. In December, the Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a bill that bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy—and before fetal viability. Under current abortion jurisprudence, states are blocked from outlawing abortion that early into pregnancy. However, on Sept. 1, Texas enacted SB 8, a six-week ban that, unlike its predecessors, actually managed to go into effect. The Supreme Court initially declined to block the ban but has since heard arguments in the case. Unlike past six-week bans, the Texas abortion ban is not enforced by the state government but by ordinary people. Individuals may sue anyone who “aids or abets” an illegal abortion—including, potentially, an Uber driver for taking a patient to an abortion clinic. A successful lawsuit nets $10,000 in damages. Ahead of the Texas ban’s enforcement, patients and providers desperately raced against the clock to provide abortions that would soon become illegal. One Texas doctor even performed 67 abortions in the hours before the ban took effect. But days later, abortion clinics saw a dramatic drop in their ability to help patients, as only a fraction qualified for abortions under the stringent law. Patients are now seeking abortions across state lines—and even international borders, since getting an abortion in Mexico is now easier than in Texas. This citizen-enforced law has spurred anti-abortion vigilantes to spread the word on how to enforce it. Supporters of the law have even created whistleblower websites that are meant to act as tip lines for possible violators (and abortion rights proponents have struck back with Shrek porn). Even Reddit had a short-lived abortion bounty hunter community that sought to enrich themselves with the reward money, although the community was banned for breaking the website’s rules about harassment. The Texas ban’s unique form of enforcement has bedeviled attempts to strike it down. When the Supreme Court declined to stop the ban, the justices didn’t rule on the law’s constitutionality but instead wrote that the case presented “complex and novel procedural questions” that had not yet been addressed. Lawmakers in other red states have now suggested that they are interested in adopting a version of the Texas ban. But the Supreme Court’s original refusal to act doesn’t mean that the court battle over the law is over. The Justice Department sued over the ban, leading a U.S. district judge to temporarily freeze it. A federal appeals court soon lifted that freeze, putting the ban back into effect, and ordered a round of oral arguments over the law. The Justice Department has since asked the Supreme Court to once again weigh in, and, in early November, the justices heard oral arguments in two challenges to the Texas ban. In the November oral arguments, however, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett suggested that they had some skepticism about the Texas law. But the fact that the Supreme Court at first chose not to act—and its willingness to consider a separate case that could overturn Roe—don’t bode well for the future of abortion rights in the United States. While state-level Republicans worked to pass abortion restrictions, President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices to the bench: Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. (Barrett’s personal lack of support for abortion rights is particularly well-documented.) All three justices supported letting the Texas ban take effect, alongside Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. In March 2018, Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law a 15-week abortion ban. Like the Texas ban, the Mississippi law contained no exceptions for incest or rape and flies in the face of abortion jurisprudence that protects abortion ahead of fetal viability. (That benchmark is usually pegged at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.) Unlike the Texas ban, a federal judge has blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect, thanks to a lawsuit brought by the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the last abortion clinic left standing in Mississippi. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on Dec. 1. With six conservative justices, the case could very well mark the end of Roe. In 1970, a pregnant woman named Norma McCorvey filed a lawsuit against Henry Wade, then the Dallas County district attorney, under the pseudonym Jane Roe. McCorvey and her attorneys argued that Texas law, which at the time prohibited abortions unless they were necessary to save the life of the mother, were unconstitutional. Eventually, the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which, in January 1973, ruled in favor of McCorvey. The ruling came too late for McCorvey: By that time, she already had her child and put her up for adoption. McCorvey would go onto to act as both a pro- and anti-abortion advocate, although shortly before her death she confessed that she’d only joined the anti-abortion movement because they paid her well. In Roe, the Supreme Court found the right to abortion was embedded in the right to privacy, which is not specifically listed in the Constitution but can be constructed through a few different legal maneuvers. The right to privacy described in Roe has its roots in other landmark cases—most notably, the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut, which expanded access to birth control. In other words, if Roe goes, it could unwind protections for other rights. Subsequent cases have refined and rewritten Roe’s findings, but the case now acts as a kind of ground-level protection for abortion access. Without it, states can be free to do as they please. The Supreme Court will have a chance to weigh this very question in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case. And it’s not looking particularly rosy for abortion rights supporters right now. Although the abortion rights movement triumphed at the Supreme Court in a 2019 case, the justices have now agreed to evaluate whether “all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.” At least four justices must agree to take up a case in order for the Supreme Court to do so—which means that at least four justices are interested in revisiting what’s widely believed to be Roe’s core holding. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on Dobbs by next summer. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House have passed the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe into federal law. The bill, however, is likely doomed in the gridlocked Senate.

The plan is to distribute 22,000 “empowerment kits” this year. “We felt it was very important for patients to have as many tools on hand to help them meet this really onerous law,” said Elizabeth Cardwell, lead clinician at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, which has 24 clinics across the northern and central regions of the state and provides care to tens of thousands of people annually. Most of their patients—who tend to be uninsured and have annual household incomes under $25,000—had not known about S.B. 8 the first several weeks after implementation, said Cardwell. But once they learned about it, patients seemed to rush to get on birth control, she said. S.B. 8 allows private citizens, in Texas or elsewhere, to sue anyone who performs an abortion in the state or who “aided or abetted” someone getting an abortion once fetal cardiac activity is detected. This is generally around six weeks, before most people know they’re pregnant. It’s had a chilling effect in Texas, where access to abortion was already limited. Medical staffs are doubling down on educating patients about birth control. They recognize the strategy isn’t foolproof but are desperate to prevent unintended pregnancies, nearly half of which nationwide end in abortion. “It’s more important now than it ever has been,” said Cardwell. “I’ve been in abortion care 30-plus years, and my go-to line was, ‘You’ve got plenty of time. You don’t have to feel rushed. Talk with your partner. Talk with your family,’” she said. “Now we don’t have that luxury.” Patients, too, seem to feel a sense of urgency. During September, according to data from Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, medical staff provided patients with some form of birth control—for example, pill packs, Depo-Provera shots or IUD implant insertions—in more than 3,750 visits. That represented a 5% increase over September 2020. Dr. Jennifer Liedtke, a family physician in West Texas, said she and her nurse practitioners explain S.B. 8 to every patient who comes to their private practice. In September, they saw a 20% increase in requests for long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, known as LARCs, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and hormonal implants. LARCs have become increasingly appealing because they are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy and last several years. They’re also simpler than the pill, which needs to be taken daily, and the vaginal ring, which needs to be changed monthly. Still, LARCs aren’t everyone’s preferred method of birth control. For example, inserting an IUD can be painful. A doctor’s office is one of the few opportunities for reliable birth control education. Texas law doesn’t require schools to teach sex education, and if they do, educators must stress abstinence as the preferred birth control method. Some doctors opt to explain abortion access in the state when naming birth control options. Liedtke is used to having to explain new laws passed by the Texas legislature. “It happens all the time,” she said. But the controversy surrounding SB 8 confuses patients all the more as the law works its way through the court system with differing rulings, one of which briefly blocked the measure. The U.S. Supreme Court heard related arguments on Nov. 1. “People just don’t understand,” said Liedtke. “It was tied up for 48 hours, so they are like, ‘It’s not a law anymore?’ Well, no, technically it is.” Not all providers are able to talk freely about abortion access. In 2019, the Trump Administration barred providers that participate in the federally funded family planning program, Title X, from mentioning abortion care to patients, even if patients themselves raise questions. In early October, the Biden Administration reversed that rule. The change will kick in this month. Planned Parenthood can discuss S.B. 8 in Texas because Texas affiliates do not receive Title X dollars. Dr. Lindsey Vasquez of Legacy Community Health, the largest federally qualified health center in Texas and a recipient of Title X dollars, said she and other staff members have not discussed abortion or S.B. 8 because they also must juggle a variety of other priorities. Legacy’s patients are underserved, she said. A majority live at or below the federal poverty level. Nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, “we’re literally maximizing those visits,” Vasquez said. Their jobs go beyond offering reproductive care. “We’re making sure they have food resources, that they have their housing stable,” she said. “We really are trying to make sure that all of their needs are met because we know for these types of populations—patients that we serve—this may be our only moment that we get to meet them.” Specialized family planning clinics that receive Title X dollars do have proactive conversations about contraceptive methods, according to Every Body Texas, the Title X grantee for the state. Discussions about long-acting reversible contraception must be handled with sensitivity because these forms of birth control have a questionable history among certain populations—primarily lower-income patients. In the 1990s, lawmakers in several states, including Texas, introduced bills to offer cash assistance recipients financial incentives to get an implant or mandate insertion for people on government benefits, a move seen as reproductive coercion. “It’s important for a client to get on the contraceptive method of their choice,” said Mimi Garcia, communications director for Every Body Texas. “Some people will just say, ‘Let’s get everyone on IUDs’ or ‘Let’s get everybody on hormonal implants’ because those are the most effective methods. … That’s not something that’s going to work for [every] individual. … Either they don’t agree with it philosophically or they don’t like how it makes their body feel.” It’s a nuanced subject for providers to broach, so some suggest starting the conversation by asking the patient about their future. “The best question to ask is, ‘When do you want to have another baby?’” said Liedtke. “And then if they say, ‘Oh, gosh, I’m not even sure I want to have more kids’ or ‘Five or six years from now,’ then we start talking LARCs. … But if it’s like, ‘Man, I really want to start trying in a year,’ then I don’t talk to them about putting one of those in.” The Biden Administration expected more demand for birth control in Texas, so Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced in mid-September that Every Body Texas would receive additional Title X funding, as would local providers experiencing an influx of clients as a result of S.B. 8. But providers said improved access to contraception will not blunt the law’s effects. It will not protect patients who want to get pregnant but ultimately decide on abortion because they receive a diagnosis of a serious complication, their relationship status changes or they lose financial or social support, said Dr. Elissa Serapio, an OB-GYN in the Rio Grande Valley and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health “It’s the very best that we can do,” said Cardwell, of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. “There’s no 100% effective method of birth control.” KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

Both shows were recorded in Texas, and in a statement announcing the releases, the group said “abortion is embraced as health care and a human right.” Sales from both live records will benefit Fund Texas Choice and the Abortion Support Network, and the previously unreleased shows are available to stream today via Bandcamp. The first album is from their November 15, 1995 performance at the Austin Music Hall, from Sonic Youth’s Washing Machine tour. The second captures their June 24, 2006 show at the Gypsy Tea Room in Dallas, a part of their Rather Ripped tour. They also have revealed three vintage Texas concert and Texas-themed t-shirts to raise funds for Women’s Choice. Two of the t-shirts bear photographs from the band’s friend and Texas photographer Pat Blashill, reading “Support the power of women” and “Fund Texas choice!” The third features a variation of Richard Prince’s “Dude Ranch Nurse” artwork. The second tweet of the band’s announcement thread of the new material reads: “In response to alarming restrictive legislative measures against the women of TX (& increasingly elsewhere) SY have announced new releases on their @Bandcamp & merch store to fundraise for @fundtexaschoice.” <a href=""https://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-austin-1995"">Live In Austin 1995 by Sonic Youth</a><a href=""https://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-austin-1995"">Live In Austin 1995 by Sonic Youth</a> <a href=""https://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-dallas-2006"">Live In Dallas 2006 by Sonic Youth</a><a href=""https://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-dallas-2006"">Live In Dallas 2006 by Sonic Youth</a> Concerts available on #Bandcamp: https://t.co/cEjTVXPlD9 Shop T-shirts: US: https://t.co/jlOjmXke2KEU: https://t.co/1ImadkxRmz 1/5 pic.twitter.com/9LY5snFBpC — Sonic Youth (@thesonicyouth) November 5, 2021 Two vintage live sets are now available in full: 1995 Austin Music Hall and 2006 Gypsy Tea Room, Dallas.

2021-11-05	13:14:14+00:00	Unknown	catholicreview	Bishops: Bill would help many but its funding of abortion is ‘unacceptable’	https://catholicreview.org/bishops-bill-would-help-many-but-its-funding-of-abortion-is-unacceptable/	 November 5, 2021By Julie Asher Catholic News Service Filed Under: Feature, News, Respect Life, World News WASHINGTON (CNS) — The proposed Build Back Better Act has much-needed provisions “uplifting the common good,” but “it is completely unacceptable” the current House version of the bill “expands taxpayer funding of abortion,” the chairmen of six committees of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said Nov. 3. “We have been consistent in our position and reiterate that it would be a calamity if the important and life-affirming provisions in this bill were accompanied by provisions facilitating and funding the destruction of unborn human life,” they wrote in a joint letter to all members of the House and Senate. The six prelates commended “the bipartisan efforts that led to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” which will create millions of jobs, improve global competitiveness and provide new funds for roads, bridges, the electric grid and other major projects. The bishops also outlined their support for social policies and programs in the Build Back Better Act that would strengthen the social safety net, support workers and families, increase affordable housing, provide affordable health care coverage and protect the environment. They renewed their requests to Congress — outlined in at least four other letters to lawmakers over the last several months — “to work together toward legislation that promotes the common good and the dignity of every person.” The Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act was passed by the Senate in August and awaits action in the House, whose members have refused to pass it without also holding a vote on the Build Back Better Act at the same time. The latter measure is still being negotiated in the Senate. The USCCB chairmen who signed the Nov. 3 letter were: Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, Committee for Religious Liberty; Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, Committee on Pro-Life Activities; Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development; Bishop Michael C. Barber of Oakland, California, Committee on Catholic Education; Bishop David A. Konderla of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Subcommittee for the Promotion and Defense of Marriage; and Auxiliary Bishop Mario E. Dorsonville of Washington, Committee on Migration. In addition to their opposition on abortion funding in the bill, the bishops also expressed concern about provisions that could effectively exclude faith-based providers from child care and pre-K programs. Several provisions “do not align” with preserving religious liberty and expanding access to early childhood education, the bishops said. “Expanded access to early child care and pre-K would be beneficial for many working families,” they said, but “current provisions to do so — in a departure from the approach in existing federal programs — explicitly make providers recipients of federal financial assistance and attach new and troubling compliance obligations.” They also pressed Congress to include a provision in the Build Back Better bill that would provide for the full integration of people in this country without documents by legalizing their status and providing them with a pathway to citizenship. “We strongly urge you to adopt provisions in this measure that would achieve this goal,” they wrote. “While we remain opposed to the existence of a ‘double society,’ in the event that parliamentary constraints preclude permanent protections for the undocumented from being included in this bill,” they said, “we would affirm the value of enacting temporary protections, with the expectation that Congress will work expeditiously to enact permanent relief in subsequent legislation.” The committee chairmen praised the Build Back Better bill’s expansion of health care coverage, which they have long supported at the federal and state levels, they said. These provisions include the provision of health care coverage to those in the “Medicaid gap” through Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, the extension of Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months and other investments to address the high rates of preventable maternal deaths in the United States, and support for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. “We are pleased to see the addition of funding for training of health professionals in palliative medicine and hospice care,” they said, but they also strongly urged “the addition of language to ensure that this funding cannot be used for training or promotion of assisted suicide or euthanasia.” Their letter concluded with reiterating the “fundamental problem” of expanded abortion funding in the measure. This “must be remedied before the bill moves forward,” they wrote. Copyright © 2021 Catholic News Service/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
2021-11-05	06:33:34+00:00	Lily Nevo	dailynorthwestern	Nevo: Keep culture wars out of the Court	https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/05/lateststories/nevo-keep-culture-wars-out-of-the-court/	 Lily Nevo, Assistant Opinion EditorNovember 5, 2021 On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments against Senate Bill 8 — the Texas abortion law that bans abortions after a heartbeat is detected, with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. As yet another abortion case reaches the Court, and pundits debate Roe v. Wade’s chances of survival, the real question should be whether the Court is the best place to settle the abortion issue. Though the Texas law seems to be a clear violation of Roe v. Wade — the 1973 decision that granted the freedom to privately choose whether to terminate a pregnancy — the Supreme Court is not debating the constitutionality of the law, but rather an individual’s right to challenge it. The law grants private citizens, not the state, the right to enforce it. Plaintiffs who sue anyone involved in aiding someone who has received or plans to receive an abortion are not only reimbursed the cost of their legal fees, but they are also given $10,000 if they win the lawsuit. In other words, Texas is paying its citizens to participate in legal vigilantism, giving culture warriors prosecutorial power. The Supreme Court has long been involved in culture wars. It has and will continue to hear cases on LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, gun rights and free speech. Yet, with President Donald Trump’s three controversial appointments that pushed the Court to a 6-3 conservative majority, the politicization of the Court must be called into question. In 2019, Supreme Court favorability was the most politically polarized for the first time in two decades. 75% of surveyed Republicans approved, compared to 49% of surveyed Democrats. This was before Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed and the Court swung even more heavily conservative. Furthermore, this split fell along religious lines: 72% of surveyed white, evangelical Protestants and 70% of surveyed Catholics viewed the Court as favorable, compared to 51% of those surveyed who were unaffiliated with a religious group. The numbers for surveyed Republicans and white evangelicals reflect a significant shift from 2015. Following the legalization of gay marriage and the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, only 33% of Republicans and 30% of white evangelicals viewed the Court favorably. In this way, the beliefs of the justices, and the extent to which they allow these beliefs to influence their decisions, impact the legitimacy of the Court in the public eye. The Court loses power when people do not respect it, and while the justices may not consider public opinion when making decisions, they always consider the Court’s reputation. When the Court tackles culture wars, justices are automatically assumed to be political pawns. And when values are central to confirmation hearings, the Court appears to be the country’s moral compass. Yet in debates rooted in personal beliefs, no single institution or argument can sway public opinion. When both sides weaponize morality, there is no room for evidence, loopholes and technicalities because generalized facts or statistics never trump an individual’s experience. The Court cannot settle culture wars, and if it continues to fight them, its approval will still be at the mercy of partisanship. Though the Court cannot simply cease to hear all socially controversial cases, it is worth acknowledging that when it does hear them, it is significantly less effective than many may think. A Roe reversal would be undeniably devastating, particularly for those with financial limitations, but the existence of Roe does not end the creation of restrictive laws. Since laws that violate Roe must face a lawsuit in order to be struck down, each new anti-abortion law creates an environment for Roe to be overturned. If Roe were overturned, abortion would likely be illegal in 22 states. However, as it exists, Roe does not stop restrictions from being implemented; it only allows them to be challenged as unconstitutional. In other words, the net benefit brought by the existence of Roe is mitigated by the significant risk of harm that would be brought by its destruction. A court precedent does not hold enough legal power to truly prevent restrictions. Fortunately, Roe will likely not be overturned with the Texas law. Due to the shaky legal ground of the law’s enforcement, it would not serve as a strong anti-abortion precedent. Still, if the Texas law is struck down, it will have made an immeasurable impact in the time that court delays and logistics allowed it to be in effect. Rather than relying on the Court to settle the abortion debate, abortion rights activists should focus their efforts on the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021. This act, which has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives, will protect abortion rights at the federal level for all people with the ability to become pregnant. By asserting the right to choose at the federal level, abortion restrictions will be untouchable by states. Furthermore, by releasing the Court from the burden of deciding morality cases, its credibility will be restored, and by democratizing morality issues, laws can better reflect individual opinion.

2021-11-05	04:28:58+00:00	Unknown	baylorlariat	Bears for Life created to support students who are pregnant, parenting	https://baylorlariat.com/2021/11/04/bears-for-life-created-in-support-of-pregnant-or-parenting-students/	The Bears for Life club at Baylor emphasizes to women that they don’t have to drop out of college or abort if they are pregnant or parenting while earning their degree. Aside from encouraging women to not quit school due to pregnancy or parenting, Bears for Life also works to support all innocent human life from conception. According to David Folks, Rockwall junior and president of Bears for Life, the club was chartered in 1998 by John Pisciotta, who was an economics professor at Baylor and the founder of Pro-Life Waco. In the club, members are given the opportunity to listen to guest speakers who take on pro-life topics from their perspectives. Through these speakers, they are also given advice as to how they can help their community and get involved. Some of the speakers the club has hosted are Paul Brown, a speaker from Lovelife, Deborah McGregor, the president and CEO of Care Net Pregnancy Center of Central Texas; and an adoption trio of a birth mom, adoptive mom and child. The club has also invited Destiny Herndon, a pro-life feminist who founded New Wave Feminists, to provide insight from another point of view. Another activity members can participate in is the 40 Days for Life movement, which involves a series of peaceful protests outside of facilities like Planned Parenthood twice a year, with each series lasting 40 days. This fall, the movement took place in 612 different locations to advocate an end to abortion through prayer. “We are unapologetically Christian, and we’re pro-life,” Folks said. “If somebody is willing to stand up for those principles, then we don’t really care what your political ideology is.” Members have also set up a table on 5th Street during Dr Pepper Hour. They distributed business cards that read, “You can be pregnant on campus” and included a QR code people could scan to find a 46-page research document they made to show available resources. “Part of our mission statement is to create the culture of life on Baylor’s campus through having meaningful conversations,” Folks said. “So absolutely we want to meet people like that and deal with their actual objections.” Folks also spoke about how the club interacts with pregnant and post-abortive women. He said the sidewalk ministry they promote organizes “blessing bags” for pregnant women, which carry resources and stuffed teddy bears; these are handed out to those who are considering walking into Planned Parenthood in order to inform them about alternative options. He said the sidewalk ministry also organizes “blessing bags” for post-abortive women, which contain information on where to get free abortion pill reversals and counseling resources. “It’s not just women before they get an abortion that we’re trying to address,” Joy Moore, Maumelle, Ark., sophomore and director of operations of Bears for Life, said. “It’s also once they walk out of that facility. That hasn’t changed how much God loves them or anything along those lines, but it’s just another way for us to reach out to them.” Currently, Bears for Life is offering a scholarship to students who are pregnant or parenting. Those who are interested in applying for the scholarship can click here to find more information. Folks also said they don’t look down on anyone because of something they did and would never condemn anyone because they made the decision to abort. He also said a lot of the women who are involved in the leadership of the national pro-life movement are post-abortive women who had a change of heart after their decision. Moore said her beliefs were mainly influenced by how the pro-life movement addresses pregnant and parenting women. “We take it and say, ‘However that child was conceived doesn’t matter,'” Moore said. “I don’t care if she made a mistake or didn’t make a mistake or if she wanted a child or if she didn’t. If she’s a pregnant parenting student here at Baylor, just because she’s pregnant doesn’t mean she shouldn’t be able to attain her education.” Moore said pregnant women’s options should not be limited to either ending the life of their pre-born child or having to drop out of college. Moore also said the club has not received hate because people have a hard time being angry at activism that promotes women’s lives and education and that helps those who are in a pregnancy or parenting crisis. “Once people know what we do and … why we’re doing it, I think we get a lot less anger and frustration,” Moore said. “Sometimes, we even get someone pro-choice shaking your hand because they’re grateful that their friends have these options.” Moore said Bears for Life’s mission is to “equip students to creat a culture of life on campus and in the community through activism, educational events, guest speakers and volunteering.” The club has meetings every other Thursday at 7 p.m. in Tidwell 101. The club also does tabling on 5th St. in front of the Bill Daniel Student Life Center for students to share their perspectives every other Tuesday. There are currently around 200 members in Bears for Life, and there are no required dues. Folks and Moore encouraged students who are interested to reach out through Connect.

According to Biden, the pope told him he was happy that our president was a “good Catholic” and that he had his permission to keep receiving Communion. Of course, there were no cameras, so it could just be Joe doing that plagiarism thing he’s perfected. Personally, however, I don’t doubt that Pontiff told POTUS that he could continue doing what he had every intention of doing anyway, shoving his unrepentant pro-abortion politics in the face of practicing anti-abortion Catholics. Despite the opposition of American bishops and many conservative faithful like myself who are deeply troubled by this façade of piety, Biden and his many supporters (a large portion of which calls itself Catholic) think his advocacy for abortion rights should be brushed off like some annoying flake of dandruff on the wings of St. Michael. Given his public comments, I believe that the pope was willing to forgive this lost sheep from Wilmington. I know I’m not going to change hearts, minds and eternal souls with my words. That’s not my intention, nor is it within my power to tell someone how to approach their relationship with God and their conception of morality. But silence is not an option when it comes to the hypocrisy of people who regularly attack others as immoral, and we’ve seen how both of the two most powerful Catholics have done that. Francis talked about the evil of “building walls,” a distinct dig at Trump, while Biden has gone after everyone, including and most especially Republicans who stand in the way of his agenda. I cannot do is sit idly by while the leader of my faith and the leader of my country live out this elderly bromance for the world to see without expressing how depressed, how disrespected and how very, very angry it makes me. Among all faiths, Catholicism has been the most vocal in its opposition to the destruction of human life in utero. It has also been outspoken against the death penalty, fiercely supportive of immigrants and refugees, cognizant of our stewardship of the earth and concerned with the welfare of the disabled and the dispossessed. As Cardinal Joseph Bernardin described it in terms more poetic than any bible verse, it is all about the “seamless garment of life.” So when two extremely high profile members of that faith seem to excuse the ripping and tearing and destruction of that radiant garment at the hem, at the beginning where life takes hold and becomes manifest in the fertilized embryo, I have a big problem with the messaging. Women like the acolytes of Planned Parenthood can get out there with their “I’m Glad I had An Abortion” T- shirts and parade their obscene pride in this barbarity on social media, and I just wince and scroll by. People like Nancy Pelosi can act like theologians and talk about how abortion is actually permitted by the church, and I just laugh and excuse the octogenarian’s little mental blip. But if the pope doesn’t draw the line in the sand when that “good Catholic” deliberately flouts a core principle of our faith, I don’t know why I should obey any of the rules myself. What does it even mean to be a Catholic anymore? Don’t answer, I think I already know. We apparently get to write our own rules now because “Who is he to judge?” Copyright 2021 Christine Flowers, distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.

It may seem that Humboldt County would have been as far away as one could get from the events around the Civil War, but in fact, we were very much involved. Though California was officially a Union state, the great move west during the Gold Rush and beyond brought Easterners from the South as well as the North. News reached our coast with some delay through unreliable wire service or newspapers delivered by ship, but people watched it avidly. When the war broke out, supporters of the Confederacy were vocal here, leading occasionally to hot confrontations. Some “Copperheads” were driven into hiding or driven out altogether while some voluntarily returned to the South to support the Confederacy. Among the soldiers stationed at Fort Humboldt, those from the South were allowed to resign if they wished to return home and fight for their states. And for the locals supporting the Union, the fact that Ulysses S. Grant had once been stationed at Fort Humboldt greatly inflated their pride. But Humboldt County had another unusual tie with the Civil War era. It had to do with John Brown, the militant abolitionist, whose abortive 1859 raid on the military arsenal at Harpers Ferry was one of the catalysts for the war. After Brown was captured and executed, he became a martyr for the Northern cause. The popular song “John Brown’s Body” was soon rewritten as the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Brown’s execution left his second wife, Mary Ann Brown, a widow. Two of their older sons fought with their father at Harpers Ferry and died there. Destitute and hearing from an uncle of the golden opportunities out West, Mary and her four remaining children and in-laws joined a California-bound wagon train. It was a long, arduous trip, the Browns’ notoriety leading to support and harassment along the way. The family initially settled in Red Bluff where again they were both welcomed and derided. Supporters raised funds to build Mary a house, and she worked providing nursing and midwifery to the community. Two daughters became teachers and son Salmon took up farming and raising the Merino sheep he had brought with him from the East. The climate, both physical and political, caused the family to move West again, and in 1870 the Browns settled in Rohnerville. There, the family prospered. Mary Brown became a grandmother many times over and Salmon raised sheep on large ranches near Bridgeville and Petrolia. The house where Mary lived, though heavily remodeled, still stands in Fortuna today. So, although at times we may seem isolated here in Humboldt County, we are apparently never isolated from history.

2021-11-04	10:48:18+00:00	Petit Press  a.s.	spectator	Only a small number of people support more restricted access to abortions	https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22777016/only-a-small-number-of-people-support-more-restricted-access-to-abortions.html	Only less than 10 percent of people in Slovakia would support tougher conditions on access to abortions. This stems from a recent poll carried out by the AKO agency for the junior coalition party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS). It was conducted while the parliament is supposed to discuss a draft submitted by a group of MPs from the senior coalition party Ordinary People and Ordinary Personalities (OĽaNO), led by the ultraconservative Anna Záborská. Even though women in Slovakia face several obstacles when seeking legal abortion, as stems from a recent survey by the Možnosť Voľby (Freedom of Choice) non-governmental organisation, the proposal is likely to make access even harder, as said by several experts in the gynaecology and obstetrics field as well as women’s and reproductive rights advocates. This includes the proposal to prolong the waiting period before the procedure from the current 48 hours to 72 hours, even for women seeking abortions for medical reasons. The authors of the draft say that they want to help pregnant women and families as the proposal also contains some benefits, like the contribution to purchasing a car. Recently, a different group of OĽaNO MPs submitted an amending proposal to Záborská’s draft, suggesting that it should drop restricting precautions and only keep social and economic benefits, the Denník N daily reported. Only 7.9 percent of respondents, surveyed by AKO between October 21 and 25 on 1,000 respondents, said that current abortion legislation should restrict the current conditions and access to legal abortions. On the other hand, 32.1 percent said the law should remain in its current shape, and 30.5 percent even said that the law should be amended in a way that will improve access to legal abortions. The latter option was mostly supported by the voters of Za Ľudí, Progressive Slovakia, and SaS. There was quite high support among the voters of the far-right People’s Party Our Slovakia (ĽSNS), whose representatives have submitted several other proposals restricting access to abortions. The tougher rules on access to abortions was mostly supported by the voters of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), while the voters of the Hungarian party Alliance and opposition parties Smer and Hlas would keep the status quo. The survey also showed that 44.3 percent of respondents opine that state hospitals should certainly carry out abortions, and 29.7 percent said that they should probably perform the procedure. Only 6.8 percent said state hospitals should not carry out abortions, and 3.1 percent said they should be banned completely. As for the waiting period before the procedure, 40.7 percent said it is not necessary, while 26.7 percent said there should be such a period. The pollster also asked about medication abortion, also known as an abortion pill, which many experts consider a safer method than surgical abortion. Slovak legislation currently does not offer this possibility. About 40.2 percent of respondents said they would support its introduction, and 8.2 percent said that the surgical method is safer. About one-third of respondents could not answer the question, claiming that they lack sufficient information. The introduction of the abortion pill is mostly supported by the voters of Progressive Slovakia, Za Ľudí, Dobrá Voľba and SaS.

Although Vice President Kamala Harris is responsible for tie-breaking in the evenly split Senate, the chamber’s makeup and the filibuster mean that many bills are blocked from being debated, let alone receiving a final vote. Mounting GOP attacks this year on reproductive freedom and voting rights at the state level have heightened pressure on Senate Democrats to reform or end the filibuster—but doing so requires support from the full caucus, and there are still some holdouts. TOMORROW the Supreme Court will be considering the greatest threat to Roe v. Wade.We can’t trust Trump’s conservative justices to uphold the current precedent and block this cruel Texas law. It’s time to end the filibuster and guarantee abortion rights. Members of Fix Our Senate—a coalition of more than 80 groups working to “ensure that the promises of progress are not blocked by the filibuster”—ramped up pressure Monday on congressional leaders as the Supreme Court’s right-wing supermajority considered the anti-choice Texas law that critics say blatantly violates the constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade. “We are organizing day in and day out to put a permanent stop to the unconstitutional bans that states like Texas are placing on our bodies,” said Desireé Luckey and Monica Edwards, leaders at URGE (Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity), a member of Fix Our Senate. “Unfortunately, the right to have an abortion will remain in peril as long as the filibuster remains intact—our broken democratic structures are blocking progress at every turn,” Luckey and Edwards continued in their statement. The American people strongly support #RoeVWade—about 70% of Americans want it to remain the law of the land. We can't wait for SCOTUS to do the right thing. The Senate should get rid of the filibuster so we can pass legislation to protect abortion rights. pic.twitter.com/Vnfx38MIxa Noting that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) “only needed 51 votes to pack the Supreme Court with three ultra-conservative justices,” the pair argued that “we should only need 51 votes to protect our right to abortion access and make choices for our bodies.” “Senate Democrats, who say they support reproductive rights but remain silent on or against the filibuster, are supporting reproductive rights in name only,” they added. “We deserve federal legislation to protect abortion access, and that requires a path forward, free from the filibuster.” Their comments echoed digital, television, and print advertisements that Fix Our Senate is running in national, Washington, D.C., and Arizona markets. The TV ad says that “as long as the Senate rules are rigged, abortion access is vulnerable. Our healthcare should matter more.” After the Supreme Court let the Texas ban, Senate Bill 8, take effect, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vowed to hold a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), which would codify Roe into federal law. Nearly all Democrats in the lower chamber came together in September to approve that bill, but it now faces an uncertain future in the Senate. The high court—which last week yet again refused to temporarily block the Texas ban while it’s being challenged—has said it will not consider the broader question of Roe for the Lone Star State’s case, but justices are set to weigh the landmark ruling in another case this session. Sonja Spoo, director of reproductive rights campaigns at the group UltraViolet—another member of Fix Our Senate—highlighted Monday that Senate Democrats could send WHPA to Biden’s desk if they killed the filibuster. “Right now, anti-abortion extremist lawmakers and judges are on the verge of overturning Roe v. Wade and effectively ending access to abortion throughout the nation,” she said. “We cannot protect abortion access or voting rights without federal intervention and passing bills like the Women’s Health Protection Act.” Senate Republicans this year have blocked the bold voting rights package known as the For the People Act as well as a compromise bill for which Sen. Joe Manchin (D-V.Wa.), a key opponent of abolishing the filibuster, tried and failed to win 10 GOP votes. “Federal legislation is critical to protecting the lives and basic rights of women and women of color, who are the primary targets of attacks on our voting right[s] and abortion rights,” said Spoo. “We will do whatever it takes to ensure that members of Congress hear our demands and urge Senate leadership to use every tool at their disposal, including ending the filibuster, to protect the constitutional right to vote, and have an abortion.” As Common Dreams reported earlier Monday, in addition to calls to end the filibuster, the Supreme Court’s review of the Texas abortion law also sparked demands for Democrats to expand the court, to which former President Donald Trump appointed three right-wing justices with help from McConnell. Although congressional progressives have put forth legislation—the Judiciary Act of 2021—that would add four seats to the nation’s top court, it currently lacks the support needed to pass either Democrat-controlled chamber, even if the Senate reformed or abolished the filibuster.

2021-11-03	20:15:31+00:00	Lisa Needham	americanindependent	Complete abortion ban would widen racial gap in maternal mortality rates, study shows	https://americanindependent.com/maternal-mortality-rates-texas-abortion-ban-study-black-pregnancy/	"New analysis shows non-Hispanic Black people will be disproportionately impacted if activists and legislators succeed at banning abortion entirely. Abortion availability in Texas has plummeted as the state continues to litigate over S.B. 8, its highly restrictive abortion law. Now a concerning new study shows that maternal mortality rates could increase if abortion becomes completely unavailable, a clear goal of many anti-abortion legislators and activists, impacting the Black community significantly. In the last several years, Texas has made strides in addressing its overall maternal mortality rate. The state's 2014 rate was the worst in the country, but by 2018 it had fallen to only slightly above the national average. That improvement in overall numbers, however, obscures the fact that vast racial disparities persist. The most recent data available shows that while Black women represent 11% of live births in the state, they account for 31% of pregnancy-related deaths in Texas. There's a vast gap too in severe maternal morbidity, outcomes of pregnancy that result in short- or long-term consequences to the mother's health. According to the state's Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee, if those types of conditions are left untreated, they can result in death, so those indicators are closely tied to maternal mortality. If Texas were to succeed at banning abortion entirely, the racial gap would likely increase dramatically. A new study conducted by Amanda Stevenson, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, that examined data at a nationwide level estimates that if a total abortion ban were to pass, there would be a 7% increase in pregnancy-related deaths nationwide in the first year following such a ban, with an increase of 21% in subsequent years. For Black people, though, there would be a 12% jump in the first year and a 33% increase in later years. Put another way, the risk of death for Black people during pregnancy would jump from 1 in 1,300 to 1 in 1,000. ""Both in terms of the number of additional deaths and in terms of the increase in risk, the additional mortality burden is estimated to be greatest among non-Hispanic Black women,"" Stevenson writes. ""Structural racism is a fundamental cause of maternal health inequity and Black women already experience excessive levels of pregnancy-related mortality."" She adds, ""Increasing Black women's exposure to the risk of pregnancy-related mortality because their wanted abortions are denied would exacerbate an existing public health crisis."" Texas-specific estimates are equally grim. A review of data by Dr. David Eisenberg, an abortion provider in Missouri and Illinois, estimates that S.B. 8, though it does not constitute a total ban, could lead to a 15% increase in maternal mortality next year in the state. For Black people, that number is much higher — 33%. In contrast to the state's vast appetite for abortion restrictions, there has been little attempt to address the maternal mortality gap. Even relatively low-cost proposals such as providing racial bias training for medical personnel and creating a centralized registry for maternal health data have failed to make their way out of the Texas Legislature. The state did pass a law that increased post-birth Medicaid coverage from 60 days to six months, but experts say that a year of coverage after giving birth is really what is needed. An attempt to pass such a law, extending Medicaid coverage for a year, was opposed by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott and Republicans in the Legislature. Texas lawmakers said they passed S.B. 8 partly because of its ""compelling interest"" in protecting women's health, but there's no evidence the law does that at all. Rather, the steep decrease in abortion access caused by the law appears poised to exacerbate the health crisis that pregnant people in the state already face.

2021-11-03	20:00:00+00:00	Jacob Sullum	suntimes	The Texas abortion law is a roadmap to privatized oppression	https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2021/11/3/22761579/texas-abortion-law-is-a-roadmap-to-privatized-oppression-jacob-sullum	"Even those who take a dim view of Roe v. Wade should be concerned about the implications for constitutional rights. Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone this week told the Supreme Court that people who object to his state’s abortion ban would have a chance to challenge it — eventually. But as Justice Elena Kagan noted, the process that Stone had in mind could take “many years,” during which time the law, S.B. 8, would continue to have a severe “chilling effect” on a right the Court has long said the Constitution guarantees. That prospect clearly troubled the justices, including several who take a dim view of the Court’s abortion precedents, because they recognized the broader implications. The strategy embodied by S.B. 8, which is designed not only to evade pre-enforcement review by federal courts but also to delay any definitive ruling on the law’s constitutionality by state courts, can easily be adapted to attack any right that state legislators view as dangerous or inconvenient. In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary. S.B. 8, which took effect on Sept. 1, prohibits abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which typically happens about six weeks into a pregnancy. Instead of charging state officials with enforcing its terms, the law authorizes “any person” to sue “any person” who performs or facilitates a forbidden abortion. It promises plaintiffs, who need not claim any personal injury, at least $10,000 in “statutory damages” per abortion if they win, plus reimbursement of their legal expenses. Although S.B. 8 is plainly inconsistent with what the Supreme Court has said about constitutional limits on abortion laws, its novel enforcement mechanism means that anyone who tries to make that argument in federal court will have a hard time identifying appropriate defendants. The Court grappled with that puzzle on Monday, when it heard oral arguments in two cases challenging S.B. 8. Stone repeatedly noted that people who face S.B. 8 lawsuits can defend themselves by arguing that the law is unconstitutional. But even if a state judge agreed, the ruling would apply only to that particular case. Under S.B. 8, such a decision would not stop lawsuits against other defendants. It would not even stop lawsuits against the same defendant, who still could be sued in any of the state’s 254 counties. And every one of those lawsuits would be a financial drain, since S.B. 8 does not allow prevailing defendants to recover attorney fees. A weekly overview of opinions, analysis and commentary on issues affecting Chicago, Illinois and our nation by outside contributors, Sun-Times readers and the CST Editorial Board. If a losing S.B. 8 plaintiff appealed, the case could ultimately generate a ruling with a broader impact. But for precisely that reason, anyone who supports the law would be disinclined to pursue an appeal. The success of S.B. 8 does not depend on actually winning anti-abortion lawsuits, or even on filing them. The mere threat of expensive, unending litigation has been enough to dramatically curtail abortion access in Texas, where the number of abortions performed in September was down by 50% compared to the same month in 2020. That reality explains why the Firearms Policy Coalition, which has no particular interest in defending abortion rights, filed a Supreme Court brief in support of allowing pre-enforcement challenges to S.B. 8. “Laws that deter or chill the exercise of constitutional rights violate those rights,” it said, warning that state legislators could use similar laws to undermine Second Amendment rights, religious liberty or freedom of speech. That fear was echoed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who are hardly fans of Roe v. Wade. If anyone who “sells an AR-15” or who “declines to provide a good or service for use in a same-sex marriage” were “liable for a million dollars to any citizen,” Kavanaugh wondered, would federal courts still be powerless to intervene before such lawsuits make their way through state courts? Stone conceded that his argument against blocking enforcement of S.B. 8 did not hinge on the nature of the constitutional right or the size of the bounty. Although he gets points for consistency, this invitation to privatized oppression should give pause to all Americans, no matter how they feel about abortion.

Any related articles, and user comments are shown below. Religious convictions also play a large role: 77 percent of white evangelicals believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. They believe a lot of strange, contradictory and hypocritical things. The woman's right to choose must remain in law. If evangelicals want to live by the bible they shouldn’t pick and choose which parts to follow and which to ignore. Have some integrity. Leviticus clearly states a very “liberal” stance on immigration, for example. If Evangelicals want to live by the Bible, which they widely claim, then they should embrace it in the same way as the Taliban embrace the Quran. If you don't agree with abortion, don't have one. If you are pro-life, then look after an unwanted child financially. Hypothetically, even if someone were pro-life, they should still be supporting abortion alongside better access to contraceptives and sex education. The alternative would not be no abortions. The alternative is unsafe abortions that put more lives at risk than the current framework. You don't get rid of abortion by banning it, you get rid of it by better access to things to prevent pregnancy in the first place. Even then, there are cases where wanted pregnancies must be terminated for the safety of the mother. Or for more extreme situations such as rape or incest. Try as I might, I really cannot wrap my head around the anti-abortion position. Maybe it is just people being naïve enough to assume that banning abortion would stop all abortion and everyone would live happily ever after in their families with 12 kids. If anyone can give me a serious argument that doesn't boil down to ""because my religion"", I am willing to entertain it. If evangelicals want to live by the bible they shouldn’t pick and choose which parts to follow and which to ignore. Have some integrity. Leviticus clearly states a very “liberal” stance on immigration, for example. Does Leviticus clearly define legal vs illegal immigration? There is a world of difference. It is known as obeying the law. Please explain fully. If you don't agree with abortion, don't have one. If you are pro-life, then look after an unwanted child financially. Looking after the child financially is the responsibility of the father (and mother, but mostly the father). Oh, that terrible word ""responsibility"". To chose the death of the fetus? It seems most liberals that favor abortion are also against the death penalty, such as for convicted murderer Charles Manson. Manson? Really? What on earth are you taking about? Manson!? Does Leviticus clearly define legal vs illegal immigration? There is a world of difference. It is known as obeying the law. Please explain fully. Leviticus is the word of god, apparently. I hope this can explain fully, in the word of god as it were; “Leviticus 19:33,34 – “When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.” Looking after the child financially is the responsibility of the father (and mother, but mostly the father). Oh, that terrible word ""responsibility"". A child who is born. The father is more financially responsible than the mother? Ooof. A dirty business but I would never want my sister or nieces to have to go to an underground doctor at risk of death for an abortion in the early stages. I think this will be the catalyst for a major division in the US, now that the Supreme Court is Republican. They will allow Republican states to effectively ban abortion. It will be wise for women who want the option to move to Democrat states. Given that politics in the US now functions like religion and political supporters are radicalised zealots, this may at least allow all Americans to choose to live in a state, Dem or Rep, where they will feel comfortable, rather than persisting with the antagonism caused by a federal system that flip-flops between a Republican and a Democrat leader. American politicians have deserted the centre ground, and federalism depends upon compromise and consensus. Like the UK after Brexit, the US is now dividing into two. If Evangelicals want to live by the Bible, which they widely claim, then they should embrace it in the same way as the Taliban embrace the Quran. I think they probably do already - i.e. they choose the bits they like and ignore the rest. Most religious texts have something for everybody. By giving an outsized importance to rural voters, the American electoral system enabled someone like Trump, with three million fewer voters than Hillary Clinton, to become President. As President, he was able to transform the Supreme Court into a body which does not reflect the values of the American people. Consistency is needed by both political parties. Abortion rights mean the death penalty and assisted suicide should also be fine. I'm in favor of all 3 with abortions for any reason until it isn't safe - based on the mother's health needs and desires. That isn't for me to decide. She and her doctor(s) should be deciding any actions. Govt shouldn't be in bedrooms or selecting who can love someone else - assuming consenting adults. While I don't have a problem with passports showing whatever ""gender"" someone wants, I do think that person may want to reconsider or never plan to visit some Islamic countries where it is illegal to be different. If Evangelicals want to live by the Bible, which they widely claim, then they should embrace it in the same way as the Taliban embrace the Quran. I think they probably do already - i.e. they choose the bits they like and ignore the rest. Most religious texts have something for everybody. The Bible is so difficult to interpret that there are over 45,000 denominations in today's world, each proclaiming itself as the only correct religion. The American constitution explicitly separates church and state, but that doesn't stop the religious states from trying to inject religion into law. The actual case that the supreme court is deciding now is not about abortion so much as technical legal issues. Abortion is protected constitutionally. If they grant it, it could be applied to wider issues, particularly regarding the right of individuals to sue others for undertaking abortions. Once you set a precedent that someone can sue another for undertaking a constitutionally protected right, it could end up anywhere, such as suing gun owners etc. This is apparently causing the conservative judges to waver. The American constitution explicitly separates church and state, but that doesn't stop the religious states from trying to inject religion into law. The most important laws in the US are from the Protestant religion. Belief in a Christian deity is still high in the US, especially for politicians/judges. The vast majority of US citizens will self-identify as ""christian"". Only 3% will self-identify as atheists. There is prejudice against atheists in the US, even by other atheists. It's a weird ground to tread, because a lot of their laws are also based around separating themselves from religious law. I don't disagree they had a lot of christian background that still colours their laws, even as they tried to separate themselves. In this case, most of the opposition to abortion does seem to stem from these religious laws. The atheist label is a weird one, because only 3% identify as atheist but 12% also say they don't believe there is a god...which is an atheist. I think the label itself has a negative connotation to a lot of people still. Even though I identify as a strong atheist now, growing up in the states I usually wouldn't tell that to people.

2021-10-31	19:22:29+00:00	Unknown	The New York Times	When Will the Supreme Court Hear Arguments on the Texas Abortion Law?	https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-supreme-court.html	The Supreme Court heard two challenges on Monday to the law, which bars most abortions in Texas after about six weeks of pregnancy. The first was brought by abortion providers in Texas, and the second was brought by the Justice Department. The Supreme Court hints that it may allow a challenge to the Texas abortion law. Top lawyers dueled over Texas’ novel anti-abortion law. What is Ex Parte Young, much-discussed in the Texas abortion case? After almost three hours of lively arguments, a majority of the justices seemed inclined to allow abortion providers — but perhaps not the Biden administration — to pursue a challenge to a Texas law that has sharply curtailed abortions in the state. That would represent an important shift from a 5-to-4 ruling in September that allowed the law to go into effect. Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were in the majority in that ruling, asked questions suggesting that they thought the novel structure of the Texas law justified allowing the providers to challenge it. Justice Kavanaugh said that might amount to closing a loophole. Justice Barrett said the law was structured to prevent the providers from presenting a “full constitutional defense.” Such a decision would not conclude the case or address whether the law itself is constitutional. Instead, it would return the case to lower courts for further proceedings. It was, moreover, not clear whether the court would temporarily block the law while the case moved forward if it allowed either the providers or the administration to sue. The law, which went into effect on Sept. 1, was drafted to evade review in federal court, a goal the state has so far achieved. The law, which bans most abortions after about six weeks and includes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, has caused clinics in the state to turn away many women seeking the procedure. The United States solicitor general and a lawyer for Texas abortion providers urged the Supreme Court on Monday to block enforcement of the state’s anti-abortion law, while a top lawyer for Texas told the justices they had no power to do so. Over about three hours of arguments that sometimes delved into highly technical matters, the Supreme Court wrestled with whether it could or should issue an injunction barring Texas state courts from hearing suits filed under the law, known as Senate Bill 8. The law, which bars most abortions after about six weeks, has raised novel issues because it is not clear whom a court could order not to carry it out. It relies not on government officials but on private citizens to enforce it, with $10,000 bounties for successful lawsuits. Arguing that the Texas law was blatantly unconstitutional and was chilling people’s exercise of their rights, Marc A. Hearron, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the providers, said the Supreme Court should enjoin clerks of Texas state courts from accepting such lawsuits. But Texas’ solicitor general, Judd Stone II, argued that it would be unconstitutional for the federal judiciary to enjoin a state court or state judge from hearing such lawsuits. He cited a 1908 case called Ex parte Young, which said state officials could be sued in federal court to block enforcement of unconstitutional state laws but also said that this mechanism could not be used to “restrain the state court from acting in any case brought before it.” The federal solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, argued that the principle laid out in the 1908 case did not apply to the situation raised by the Texas state law, which she said was written to evade judicial review and thwart the supremacy of federal law. “I recognize that this seems like a novel case, and that’s because this is a novel law,” Ms. Prelogar said. “But we do not think that a recognition here that the United States can intervene to try to protect the supremacy of federal law would open the floodgates” in ordinary state court proceedings. “We have to continue to speak out.” “Abortion saves lives.” “[Unclear] know best — we know what our capacity is.” “[unclear] for my Black people.” [cheering] “[unclear] so much to listen to me.” “Hey hey, ho ho, Roe v. Wade has got to go. Hey hey, ho ho —” “Abortion hurts women.” [unclear] “Pro-life, pro-woman.” Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the Supreme Court during arguments on Monday, as the justices heard challenges to the Texas law that prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. Demonstrators from around the country gathered at the foot of the steps, most carrying signs supporting abortion rights and marking the sidewalks in chalk as the arguments, which were streamed live, played from speakers. “It’s really sad to think about what women across my state are going through at the moment,” said Abby Springs, a senior at the University of Texas, Austin, who is studying in Washington for a semester. “As we speak, right now, women are having to drive hours and hours and hours across state lines just to be able to access an abortion.” Valerie Reyes-Jimenez, a community organizer from New York City, said she arrived on a bus this morning with demonstrators from Housing Works, a nonprofit that supports efforts to end AIDS and homelessness. She said she thought the Texas law was especially harmful to women’s health because of the six-week timeline. “I had an abortion when I was 13, and I have no regrets about it,” she said, adding that she had been about 10 weeks pregnant at the time. “I am a mother and a grandmother today, but I knew that was the right decision for me.” Tens of anti-abortion demonstrators were also gathered before the Supreme Court, many dressed in red and carrying red heart-shaped balloons to show their support for the Texas law, which is known as the “heartbeat act” because it bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Many were organized to attend by the Texas attorney general’s office and declined to speak with reporters. Christopher Palmer, 20, said he came to Washington from New Jersey with students from Rider University’s students for life organization to show that the Texas abortion law had support from young people. “I think the Supreme Court should allow the State of Texas to make a decision,” adding that he and his organization wanted to see the court enable “ending abortion in America, starting with Texas and going state by state.” Many of the abortion-rights demonstrators said they were planning to be back at the court on Dec. 1, when the court is scheduled to hear a case on Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Justice Sotomayor asked Mitchell why those who sue abortion providers under S.B. 8 are not agents of the state. He argued that there was no agency relationship “because the state is statutorily forbidden” from enforcing the law and therefore cannot act with private citizens who may feel moved to file a private lawsuit. Justice Kagan also seemed to reject Stone’s assertion that the United States is overstepping its boundaries in bringing its suit. If the Supreme Court upholds S.B. 8, “any state can effectively nullify any federal constitutional law,” she said. J. David Goodman Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general for Texas, is now speaking. He was a main architect of the unique structure of the Texas abortion law, which has been at the heart of the debate today. Justice Elena Kagan says most cases claiming a chilling effect are speculative. Here, she says, “we know exactly what has happened,” referring to the sharp curtailment of abortions in the state. Here is some data behind that. Justice Kagan engaged in a heated exchange with Stone, pushing back on his assertions that it was still a hypothetical that S.B. 8 had all but ended abortion in Texas. “The provisions in this law have prevented every woman in Texas from exercising a constitutional right, as declared by this court,” she said. “That’s not a hypothetical. That’s an actual.” Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who is 83 and is the senior member of the court’s liberal wing, has written opinions striking down laws that restrict abortions in Nebraska, Texas and Louisiana. In the Nebraska opinion in 2000, Justice Breyer wrote that the debate over abortion involved “virtually irreconcilable points of view.” “Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it,” he wrote. “Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.” In September, when the Supreme Court refused to block the Texas law, Justice Breyer dissented. “Texas’ law delegates to private individuals the power to prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion during the first stage of pregnancy,” he wrote. “But a woman has a federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion during that first stage.” He acknowledged some of the procedural difficulties in the case, but he said the court had the power to act and should not hesitate to be creative. “It should prove possible to apply procedures adequate to that task here,” he wrote. Whatever happens to S.B. 8, the anti-abortion movement has been successful at curtailing practical access to the procedure in Texas. There are about 24 abortion clinics in the state, compared to more than 200 “crisis pregnancy centers” aligned with anti-abortion organizations. And patients must receive an ultrasound at least 24 hours before obtaining an abortion, requiring two trips to a facility. Four justices issued dissents when the Supreme Court refused to block the Texas law, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s opinion was by many measures the most striking. “The court’s order is stunning,” she wrote. “Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.” “Because the court’s failure to act rewards tactics designed to avoid judicial review and inflicts significant harm on the applicants and on women seeking abortions in Texas,” she wrote, “I dissent.” Almost two months later, the court again refused to take immediate action against the law and instead agreed to fast-track appeals from abortion providers in the state and the Justice Department, giving rise to Monday’s arguments. Justice Sotomayor was the only member of the court to issue a dissent from its refusal to block the law in the meantime. “For the second time, the court is presented with an application to enjoin a statute enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas,” she wrote. “For the second time, the court declines to act immediately to protect these women from grave and irreparable harm.” As the Supreme Court struggled on Monday with whether it could or should block Texas courts from hearing lawsuits by private citizens against abortion providers under the state’s novel anti-abortion law, a 1908 case called Ex Parte Young kept coming up. That case involved a dispute over a Minnesota law on railroad rates and a federal lawsuit against the state’s attorney general, Edward Young. The Supreme Court held that state officials could be sued in federal court to prevent them from trying to enforce unconstitutional laws. However, the court’s majority decision, written by Justice Rufus W. Peckham, said that this mechanism could not be used to “restrain the state court from acting in any case brought before it either of a civil or criminal nature.” He added: “An injunction by a federal court against a state court would violate the whole scheme of this government, and it does not follow that, because an individual may be enjoined from doing certain things, a court may be similarly enjoined.” The twist raised by the Texas anti-abortion case is that state officials are forbidden to enforce the law, which conflicts with the Supreme Court’s current abortion rights rulings. Instead, the law is enforced by private citizens’ filing lawsuits against abortion providers, or against people who assist them or women seeking abortions. The plaintiffs — the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas — have sought to address that twist by seeking an injunction barring state courts from hearing such cases. For anti-abortion activists in Texas, this fall has been a taste of the future they have long dreamed about. “This is really a glimpse of what a post-Roe Texas is going to look like,” said John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group. “The last two months have been a victory for the pro-life movement.” On Monday the Supreme Court will take up challenges to Texas’ new anti-abortion law, the most restrictive in the nation, exactly two months after it took effect. The law, which in effect banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, had an immediate impact on the availability and practice of the procedure in the state, where access to the procedure had already been declining for years. Texas has about 24 abortion facilities, down from 40 less than a decade ago. When the new law, known as Senate Bill 8, went into effect, those clinics said they would immediately comply, with many pausing all abortion services while they sorted out the legal implications of the law. The number of abortions in the state dropped 50 percent in September 2021 compared to the same month in 2020, according to an analysis released on Friday by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. Texas has been the center of the abortion debate since Norma McCorvey, also known as Jane Roe, sought an abortion in Dallas in 1969. She wasn’t able to procure the procedure, but her attempt led to the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case, which legalized most abortions. Mr. Seago planned to be in Washington on Monday for the Supreme Court oral arguments. He said his organization was optimistic about the outcome, based in part on the fact that the court had declined to pause the law while the justices considered its validity. Not all activists were as confident. Joe Pojman, the executive director for Texas Alliance for Life, said he foresaw a possible defeat in the fact that the court had agreed to hear the case so quickly. He planned to tune into the hearing from his office in Austin. “We have not known each day when the sun rises if the courts will change,” he said. “But each day we consider a victory.” When the new Texas abortion law took effect in September, the impact was swift. With abortions largely prohibited in the state after about six weeks, Texans with unwanted pregnancies were forced to make decisions quickly. Many opted to travel out of state for the procedure. As a result, clinics in Oklahoma and beyond quickly filled up with appointments from Texans. “We had every line lit up for eight hours straight,” said Jennifer Reince, who works the front desk phones at a clinic in Oklahoma City, describing the first week the measure was in force. And as clinics in surrounding states filled up, appointments were being scheduled for later and later dates, making the procedures more costly. Abortions at the Trust Women Oklahoma City clinic range in cost from $650 for earlier stages to $2,350 for later stages. Financial assistance is also available. In the weeks immediately after the Texas law got underway, about half the patients at the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La., were from Texas, up from about a fifth before the law. At Little Rock Family Planning Services, in Arkansas, Texas patients made up 19 percent of the caseload, compared with less than 2 percent in August. Oklahoma does not require two trips to a clinic to get an abortion in most cases, so it became a common choice. At Trust Women, patients came from as far away as Galveston and Corpus Christi. Other women are having to carry their pregnancies to term. Marva Sadler, senior director of clinic services at Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four clinics in Texas, said she believed that many patients were not able to arrange child care or take time off work without losing their jobs to travel to other states. “I think a majority of women are being sentenced to being parents,” she said. By Michael S. Schmidt Jonathan F. Mitchell represents a new iteration of the anti-abortion campaign. Instead of focusing on stacking the courts with anti-abortion judges, trying to change public opinion or pass largely symbolic bills in state legislatures, Mr. Mitchell, 45, has spent the last seven years honing a largely below-the-radar strategy of writing laws deliberately devised to make it much more difficult for the judicial system — particularly the Supreme Court — to thwart them, according to interviews. Never an especially prominent, popular or financially successful figure in the conservative legal world — he was best-known for litigation seeking to limit the power of unions — Mr. Mitchell is only now emerging as a pivotal player in one of the most high-profile examples yet of the erosion of the right to abortion. The oldest of seven brothers, he was raised in a religious Christian home in Pennsylvania. He attended Wheaton College, a small school in Illinois that “prepares students to make an impact for Christ,” according to its website. Friends refrain from calling him on Sundays, as they know he spends at least several hours at church. As his role has started to become more widely known, he has drawn intense criticism from abortion rights supporters not just for restricting access to the procedure but also for what they see as gaming the judicial system through a legislative gimmick they say will not withstand scrutiny. But Mr. Mitchell, a onetime clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who has already seen one anti-abortion law that he worked on gutted by the Supreme Court, vowed that if he ever had the chance to help develop another restricting measure, he would ensure that it survived the high court’s review. The audacious legislative structure that he conceived of — built around deputizing ordinary citizens to enforce it rather than the state — has flummoxed lower courts and sent the Biden administration and other supporters of abortion rights scrambling for some way to stop it. Prelogar: “I recognize that this seems like a novel case, and that’s because this is a novel law. But we do not think that a recognition here that the United States can intervene to try to protect the supremacy of federal law would open the floodgates” in ordinary state court proceedings. As a government lawyer, as an appeals court judge and on the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. has consistently opposed legal protections for abortion. He was in the majority in September when the court refused to block the Texas law. Applying for a promotion as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration in 1985, he wrote that he was proud to have helped advance “legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly.” One of those positions, he said, was that “the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.” As an appeals court judge, he voted in 1991 to uphold a Pennsylvania law that required women seeking abortions to notify their husbands. “Pennsylvania has a legitimate interest in furthering the husband’s interest in the fate of the fetus,” he wrote. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected his position the next year in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In a combative speech at Notre Dame in September, he defended the Supreme Court’s decision not to block the Texas law, saying it turned on procedural issues and had nothing to do with the fate of Roe v. Wade. When the Supreme Court refused to block the Texas abortion law in September, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted with the court’s three liberal members in dissent. That was in one sense a surprise: There is no reason to believe that the chief justice, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush, is a committed supporter of abortion rights. But he does view himself as the custodian of the court’s prestige and authority, and he has said that the court should not lightly overrule its precedents. Last year, he voted with what was then the court’s four-member liberal wing to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, saying a recent precedent — one from which he had dissented — required the result. In his dissent in September, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that he would have blocked the Texas law while appeals moved forward. “The statutory scheme before the court is not only unusual, but unprecedented,” he wrote. “The legislature has imposed a prohibition on abortions after roughly six weeks, and then essentially delegated enforcement of that prohibition to the populace at large. The desired consequence appears to be to insulate the state from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime.” These arguments, which may be the first ones many Americans have heard, are a good look at how the justices handle the most public part of their work. Their questions are varied, probing and sophisticated. And they are in large part talking to each other. “We don’t talk about cases before the argument,” Chief Justice Roberts once said. “When we get out on the bench, it’s really the first time we start to get some clues about what our colleagues think. So we often are using questions to bring out points that we think our colleagues ought to know about.” J. David Goodman The main sponsors of the Texas abortion law, State Senator Bryan Hughes and State Representative Shelby Slawson, both Republicans, are in Washington and are expected to speak outside the Supreme Court after the arguments conclude, along with the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton. Why was there discussion of New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark libel case? The point was that The Times faced crippling liability in state courts in Southern states during the civil rights era. But the Sullivan case followed the usual pattern: The paper was sued in state court, lost and then appealed, winning in the Supreme Court. A lawyer for Texas said that was also the right way to challenge the Texas law — not by suing in federal court beforehand. At his confirmation hearings in 1991, Justice Clarence Thomas said, to the astonishment of many, that he had never discussed Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, even though it was issued while he was a student at Yale Law School. The next year, he dissented in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the majority reaffirmed the core of the Roe decision. Justice Thomas joined opinions saying Roe was “plainly wrong” and “should be overruled.” In his memoir, he reconciled his 1992 vote with his statements at his confirmation hearings the year before. “By then,” he wrote, “I’d had ample time to study Roe in detail, and concluded that it was wrongly decided and should now be overruled.” Justice Thomas, the longest serving member of the current Supreme Court, has in the intervening decades frequently voiced opposition to constitutional protection for abortion. “Nothing in our Federal Constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to determine whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother,” he wrote in a 2000 dissent. “Although a state may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a state must do so.” He was in the majority in September when the court refused to block the Texas law. Prelogar tells Justice Thomas that the Justice Department is not suing because Texas enacted an unconstitutional law, but because Texas deliberately structured the law to prevent federal courts from doing anything about the fact that it violates the Constitution. It’s a key distinction that Prelogar could use to show how other states could pass similar laws that undermine other constitutional rights. The basic contours of the Texas abortion law, S.B. 8, are well known: It bans abortions after cardiac activity is detectable, usually around six weeks’ gestation, and delegates enforcement responsibility to private citizens. But it contains many significant, and in some cases highly unusual, provisions beyond those basics. I read the law in its entirety last month and consulted with two professors who have expertise in abortion jurisprudence: Mary Ziegler of Florida State University and Melissa Murray of New York University. Here are a few takeaways, though Professor Murray cautioned that parts of the law were written so vaguely that they “could reasonably be subject to a wide range of interpretations.” The burden of proof is reversed. Normally, the person making an allegation — the prosecution in a criminal trial or the plaintiff in a civil trial — must prove it is true. The defendant doesn’t have to prove it is false: innocent until proven guilty. Not so under S.B. 8, which says those accused of performing or abetting abortions have “the burden of proving an affirmative defense.” The law’s exception for medical emergencies is vague. Some health situations aren’t clear-cut, like a cancer patient who can’t receive chemotherapy while pregnant and whose disease could become untreatable within a few months. Doctors must decide whether their patient qualifies, knowing they could be sued by anyone who disagrees. People can be sued for intent even if they never act. The law doesn’t specify what counts as intent, leaving open the possibility that a person could be sued for, say, researching the locations of abortion clinics or viewing an advocacy group’s donation page. There are no geographic limitations. Residents of other states can sue someone who helps a Texan get an abortion (in fact, the first lawsuits filed under S.B. 8 were from out-of-state residents), and they can also be sued for helping a Texan get an abortion. The law puts financial burdens on defendants. A defendant who loses will have to reimburse the plaintiff’s legal fees. But courts are forbidden to order reimbursement of the defendant’s legal fees, meaning a person falsely accused would still be on the hook for the cost of their defense. Justice Stephen G. Breyer read back a list of six reasons that Marc A. Hearron, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the providers, gave for why private lawsuits brought under S.B. 8 are unlike typical tort suits: Anybody can sue. (A reason that Justice Breyer called “debatable.”) Anyone can sue anywhere in Texas, a large state. A lawsuit brought under S.B. 8 does not stop other plaintiffs from suing the same defendant. The legal fees are serious. The $10,000 paid to successful plaintiffs is serious. Defendants have only a limited ability to argue that a lawsuit presents an undue burden. Mr. Hearron agreed with the justice’s summary and added two more reasons: Damages awarded in successful lawsuits are not tied to the amount of the harm, as is the case in most tort suits. S.B. 8 provides for a mandatory injunction to prevent further violations of the law, rather than to prevent more harm to the plaintiff. Elizabeth Prelogar, the nation’s newly confirmed solicitor general, is now presenting arguments before the Supreme Court. The Biden administration’s newly confirmed solicitor general, Elizabeth B. Prelogar, is expected to argue that the Texas law conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and to urge the justices not to be deterred from saying so by the way it was drafted to avoid judicial review. In the federal government’s brief submitted to the court, the acting solicitor general at the time, Brian H. Fletcher, wrote that “S.B. 8 was designed to nullify this court’s precedents and to shield that nullification from judicial review. So far, it has worked: The threat of a flood of S.B. 8 suits has effectively eliminated abortion in Texas at a point before many women even realize they are pregnant, denying a constitutional right the court has recognized for half a century.” “Yet Texas insists,” Mr. Fletcher added, “that the court must tolerate the state’s brazen attack on the supremacy of federal law because S.B. 8’s unprecedented structure leaves the federal judiciary powerless to intervene.”
2021-10-31	18:43:59+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	alternet	How the critical race theory hysteria may be a death blow for affirmative action	https://www.alternet.org/2021/10/critical-race-theory-affirmative-action/	"The end of abortion rights in the United States seems to be a foregone conclusion. After rejecting efforts to temporarily halt the Texas abortion law on two separate occasions, the Supreme Court may validate the law this term. Undermining Roe v. Wade, or overruling it as the court's decision on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban portends, begs the question of what other precedents the Supreme Court will be willing to weaken or abandon. Affirmative action in higher education immediately comes to mind. With the replacement of Justice Anthony Kennedy—who famously helped reaffirm the constitutionality of affirmative action in Fisher v. University of Texas—upon his retirement with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the subsequent filling of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the days of affirmative action seem as numbered as those of legalized abortions. Conservatives, skeptical of the justification for affirmative action, enjoy a majority on the Supreme Court. A viable challenge to affirmative action that was only recently shot down in federal court may receive a more favorable ruling if it is heard by a more sympathetic conservative Supreme Court. As with abortion rights, it is possible for Congress to enact legislation that protects affirmative action policies. However, the current national conversation on critical race theory suggests that these efforts would face an uphill battle. Conservative politicians, pundits, activists, and parents united during the summer of 2021 to face a common enemy. No, that enemy was not the likely candidate of the coronavirus pandemic, which so far has killed more than 700,000 Americans and counting. Nor was it the insurrectionists and anti-democracy extremists who falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. No, these allies banded together to engage in a meaningless culture war against critical race theory. The tragic murder of George Floyd in 2020 was a cultural inflection point that has inspired national introspection on the ways in which racism has permeated every facet of American life. Everyday citizens have incorporated terms like ""white privilege,"" ""implicit bias,"" and ""microaggression"" into their vocabularies. Corporations are beginning to promote internal diversity and contribute to the economic development of historically marginalized communities. Educational institutions at all levels are encouraging conversations and offering courses on institutionalized racism, which is at the core of critical race theory. But for every positive action, there is an equally opposite negative reaction. Local school board meetings have become battlegrounds. Parents and conservative activists have accused schools of using critical race theory to ""indoctrinate"" their children and spread ""Marxism."" These accusations may be the least of school districts' concerns: School board members have received threats to their safety, while many school boards have become engulfed in litigation, complaints, and record requests relating to critical race theory. Conservatives at all levels have egged on these efforts from the Fox News Network, which obsessed over critical race theory to the tune of mentioning it 1,900 times in under four months, to Trump acolyte and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who blasted critical race theory as ""[t]eaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other."" Harmful rhetoric is now giving way to tangible consequences. States like South Carolina and Idaho have passed legislation to prevent schools from teaching the principles of critical race theory. Oklahoma passed legislation clearly intended to shape the contours of how discussions of race can occur in the classroom. The debate over the place of the tenets of critical race theory in the classroom threatens to tip the scales in the Virginia governor's race. Federal conservative lawmakers have joined the chorus of criticisms, including Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Representative Dan Bishop (R-NC), both of whom introduced the Stop CRT Act. The central irony of this nonsensical hysteria is that critical race theory is a legal framework taught in law and graduate schools, not primary and secondary schools. Discussions of history, racism, and diversity are not synonymous with critical race theory, so no children were ever in so-called danger of being exposed to this pedagogy. But Republicans are well aware of the provocative nature of the term ""critical race theory."" The potential to wield that term like a battle-ax to frighten suburban white voters and ultimately frustrate progress on racial justice issues was too tempting for conservatives to ignore. That this fearmongering political strategy is working, based on the explosion of interest in school board affairs, could be the death knell for affirmative action. Before critical race theory, affirmative action was the buzzword deployed by conservatives to stoke racial division. Affirmative action has always been a controversial policy. But if this level of panic is the reaction to the mere discussion of racial inequality in schools, one can only imagine how apoplectic the reaction will be to Congress seeking to preserve or even expand affirmative action. One thing is for certain: Outrage at the presence of racial discussions in the classrooms means that there is already a coalition of opponents mobilized to challenge codifying affirmative action. Standing at the cusp of losing abortion rights has galvanized progressives, but it is hard to envision affirmative action inspiring that same level of activism, even among those who might be somewhat sympathetic. Indeed, protests against the Texas abortion law began almost immediately after it went into effect in September. Nationwide marches hosted by the Women's March to vocalize support for abortion rights totaled at least 600. Whole Woman's Health, which is part of a network of abortion clinics, sued for an injunction against the Texas abortion law. Spearheaded by women in Congress, the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021, which would maintain a woman's right to abort her pregnancy, passed in the House of Representatives. Attaining higher education is still a relative privilege, by contrast, so affirmative action is not as energizing a principle as abortion rights—which directly impact half the population—theoretically are. An argument, though one with which I disagree, could also be made that the stakes of affirmative action are not as high as other racial justice issues, including voting rights and police brutality. While legislation to address these focuses stalls, progressives in Congress may be reluctant to add protecting affirmative action to their list of priorities. As seen from the example of some conservative lawmakers in Congress who have been vocal leaders in the fight to keep racial history out of the classroom, there is no guarantee that legislation to preserve affirmative action policies would be enacted even with the enthusiasm of congressional Democrats. Furthermore, public opinion on affirmative action is tepid. Although Gallup determined that 62 percent of Americans broadly endorse ""affirmative action programs for racial minorities,"" there are indications that support narrows with respect to affirmative action in the context of higher education specifically. Shortly before the lawsuit against Harvard's affirmative action policy was set to be heard, WGBH News conducted a poll in which 72 percent of respondents opposed the Supreme Court jurisprudence allowing a person's racial background to factor into admissions decisions. Perhaps most tellingly, California voters opposed restoring the state's capacity to consider race, along with other identity elements, in admitting students to its public universities and hiring public employees. An argument could be made that if affirmative action could not survive in liberal California, what hope does it have of achieving national protection? The anger surrounding teaching children a more expansive (and truthful) version of American history can largely be understood as a backlash to the Black Lives Matter era, the victories of which have been largely symbolic and localized. The legislative entrenchment of affirmative action will be spun by conservatives as ""reverse racism"" that hampers the educational advancement of white children. That argument will hold traction among conservatives, moderates, and progressives. As we prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe future, it might also be time to anticipate a future in which affirmative action is unavailable as a means of promoting diversity in and economic mobility through higher education."

The North's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill states they're still being denied access to abortion a year after the law was changed to legalise the service, because ""political unionism"" is blocking access. The North's Health Minister is currently the Ulster Unionist Party's Robin Swann, who along with DUP politicians and other members of the Assembly, have been against legalising abortion services in Northern Ireland. O'Neill says her party wants to see compassionate services in place for women whenever they need them."

The rape victim is only 11-years-old. The church has reportedly applied pressure to prevent an abortion. According to reports, the church managed to convince the young girl’s mother to prevent an abortion in exchange for financial support. The young girl had wanted to get an abortion. Bolivia has seen feminist groups take to the streets. They are hitting out against the Catholic Church in Bolivia. They believe that the church has applied pressure to prevent an 11-year-old victim from having an abortion. One protester said: “I’m going to fight and I’m going to make my voice heard for all the girls who can’t speak.” Another protester commented: “We want to give our support to the girl and also repudiate the double standards of the hypocritical and paedophilic Church.” The girl had expressed her intention to have an abortion. She had been abused by her stepfather’s father. Reportedly the Catholic church convinced the girl’s mother to prevent an abortion. Financial support was reportedly offered in exchange for preventing the abortion. Diego Pla, deputy secretary general of the Bolivian Episcopal Conference commented: “We urge the public authorities to respect and protect the right to life and health of the girl who was the victim of rape.” The government believes that the church should not intervene in these matters. Marianela Prada, Minister of the Bolivian Presidency explained: “It is not possible for them to get involved in this way to decide about a girl who has been the victim of sexual abuse,” Nydia Pesantes, the Bolivian representative of UN Women commented: “A girl is a girl and girls are not meant to get pregnant, to give birth.” Thank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.

Historian Jon Meacham had been invited to speak about social injustice at the Samford University president inauguration on Wednesday, November 3. But his appearance at a Planned Parenthood event in Texas - where abortions are banned after six weeks - sparked outrage among anti-abortion students, who called into question his fitness to speak at the Baptist university. A petition that collected more than 1,000 signatures forced president Beck Taylor to withdraw the invitation. The petition argued that the invitation was 'not only disappointing but alarming for the future of Samford - the top-ranked Christian University in Alabama.' President Beck Taylor announced on Wednesday that withdrawing Meacham's invitation was the best course of action because the matter was now 'too divisive.' A petition that collected more than 1,000 signatures forced president Beck Taylor to withdraw the invitation for Jon Meacham to speak at the inauguration on November 3 The change.org petition read: 'Mr. Meacham is involved with raising money in support of an organization that does not value life in the same way the Christian faith does. 'As Samford is the top-ranked Christian University in Alabama, the invitation for Mr. Meacham to speak is not only disappointing but alarming for the future of Samford.' The petition went on to highlight Meacham's ties with Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of reproductive health services in the US. The historian has attended and spoken at many events organized by the non-profit. 'Jon Meacham is significantly involved with the Planned Parenthood organization. He has spoken at their fundraising events, his book is used for the Planned Parenthood fundraiser, and overall his beliefs and core values do not align with those of Samford University, as it is a Southern Baptist institution,' it concluded. Taylor, who became president of the university in July, tried to distance the institution from Meacham's pro-abortion beliefs While Taylor, who became president of the university in July, tried to distance the institution from Meacham's pro-choice beliefs, he said he valued discourse and was disappointed by having to cancel Meacham's speech as it was going to be merely focused on social injustices. 'Some in our community have assumed erroneously that Samford's invitation by extension endorses any perspectives or viewpoints Mr. Meacham may have about the sanctity of life and abortion rights,' Taylor said. He added: 'Although I am disappointed by the narrative that has combined important conversations about pro-life issues and Mr. Meacham's planned appearance at Samford, it is vitally important to me that next week's events unify and draw our community together to celebrate the history and future of Samford University, a place we love and for which we all care deeply.' Meacham has written about several presidents - including Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush - but it was his Andrew Jackson's biography American Lion that earned him the Pulitzer Prize in 2009. Those who signed the petition shared their agreement with Meacham's invitation to speak at the university. 'Samford leadership proudly states that their decisions on ALL matters are guided first and foremost by the Bible and God's teachings,' Kirk Becker commented on the petition's website. 'The decision to invite this man to speak considering he supports Planned Parenthood and their 350,000+ annual abortions runs completely contrary to this commitment,' she added. Before withdrawing the invitation, the university described Meacham as a skilled orator with a depth of knowledge about politics, religion, and current affairs. In a statement on Friday, the university announced that Meacham will be scheduled for a conference at another date at the university, 'Mr. Meacham, who is a noted historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential biographer, has been invited to our campus to highlight his work in analyzing the current state of civility and discourse in our country. We look forward to hosting him at a later date,' the statement read. Meacham has written about several presidents - including Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt, George H.W.

Part 1	https://newswithviews.com/how-can-vaccine-mandates-be-legal-part-1/	We first must look at the meaning of the word mandate. Webster’s modern dictionary states an official order to do something. It also states that one of the meanings is: the power to act that voters give to their elected leaders. In the case of the ‘vaccine’, the latter is more important than the former. Webster’s 1828 dictionary gives the meaning as: A command; an order, precept or injunction. From these definitions, it sounds like if the government decrees something that we are required to follow that command almost no matter what. The problem with that mindset is that is the mindset of a dictator. Stalin, Castro, Chavez, and that ilk. Americans have forgotten that we are a constitutional republic and a constitutional republic is a nation ruled by laws, not mandates. During World War II Germany did medical experiments on Jews, homosexuals, the mentally retarded, and many others. These ‘experiments’ were done without their consent and many times were never informed of what the ‘experiment’ was. Many of the ‘experiments’ were very painful and were done without pain medication. Injecting chemicals into the eyes while the patient was still awake, exposing them to anthrax and the list goes on and on. I would hope that by the time we got to a quarter of the way through the twenty-first century we would have reached a point where we no longer experimented on humans. But that does not seem to be the case. In all the research I’ve done on the COVID 19 ‘vaccine’ I have learned that all the animals utilized in the testing died but not from the ‘vaccine’ but from covid when it was introduced to them, According to Dr. Lee Merritt, What happened is all animals died… but they didn’t die of the “vaccine”. What they died from what used to be called “immune enhancement” and now they call it “antibody-dependent enhancement” (ADE). They make the RNA and you get the “vaccine” and you do fine. Now, you challenge the animal with the virus that you are supposed to be immunizing against. So when they challenged those cats with SARS [a.k.a. SARS-CoV-1, is a coronavirus species], instead of killing the virus or weakening it, the immune response that they built into your system when out and codded the virus, so the virus came into the cat’s body like a Trojan Horse, unseen by the cat’s own immune system, and then it replicated without checking and killed the cat with overwhelming sepsis and cardiac failure. And that [also] happened in ferrets, that happened every time they tried this. Let me just point out. We have never made it through an animal study successfully for this type of virus. We have never done this in humans before… We don’t really have a track record of success.[1] I don’t know about you but I don’t want this ‘vaccine’. Studies do show that most of the hospitalized patients with covid have been fully vaccinated. Not much of a vaccine if you ask me but this is what the Biden administration is telling us that he is mandating that we get the ‘vaccine’ or our travel may be restricted, our ability to attend certain public events like the ones where they are shouting “Let’s Go Brandon”, we may not be able to fly, travel on a train, and he’s even thinking about restricting our ability to travel from state to state without the ‘vaccine’. If you’ve ever studied history study 1930s Germany and you’ll see an eery resemblance to what the Democrats are doing in America. Now, with this information, we have to look at the laws of America. The first law we can look at is the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. Democrats think that they are a Bill of Suggestions but our basic rights were instilled in that document. Our 1st Amendment carries a large portion of the rights that the Biden Administration simply ignores. It states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.[2] Part of our freedom of religion is not having to take a ‘vaccine’ that is made partly of aborted baby cells which most if not all vaccines contain. This has created a ‘market’ for aborted babies. Follow the money. Journalist David Daleiden obtained video evidence of Planned Parenthood selling aborted baby parts which is illegal but Kamala Harris, California’s Attorney General at the time, charged David with 9 felonies but ignored the provable illegal actions of Planned Parenthood. One of the most disturbing aspects of the 1st Amendment that is being breached and ignored by our government is that of free speech. The government is supposed to see to it that these rights are not hindered in any way but the Big Tech corporations violate our free speech rights daily and the federal government does nothing. Some say they are private companies and can do what they want but they have public stockholders and the federal government has asked them to not allow certain articles that discuss the truth about COVID 19’s origins, preventive medicines, treatments, and other things that oppose the government’s position, Hunter’s laptop, Hillary’s emails, Biden’s dealing with Ukrain and the list goes on. When they comply with the requests of the government that makes them an agent of the government which in turn makes their actions illegal. If someone wants to publish information concerning their citizen’s rights to NOT abide by the mandate they are de-platformed, banned, and not allowed to express the rights our Constitution is supposed to guarantee. These are actions of dictators not of a constitutional republic. Even when people peacefully assemble to protest the forced mandates the government, specifically in blue states, will use the police to harass the protestors and arrest them for exercising their constitutional right to peacefully assemble. Police say two people were arrested during a “disturbance” outside Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee’s home, where protesters were rallying against the state’s vaccine mandate for health care workers. The two people arrested Friday night were charged with disorderly conduct, obstruction and resisting arrest, Rhode Island State Police said. Police did not provide further details about the disturbance or the reason for the arrests. McKee announced in August that all health care workers would be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.[3] Keep in mind that the survival rate for this ‘plannedemic’ is 99.98%. There is no logical reason to force anyone to get this proven dangerous ‘vaccine’. There must be other reasons that we would probably shoot them for if we knew what they really wanted to accomplish.

2021-10-30	23:33:15+00:00	Dessi Gomez	thewrap	Jon Meacham Disinvited From Alabama College After Student Anti-Abortion Protest	https://www.thewrap.com/jon-meacham-disinvited-college-student-protest/	Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham was uninvited from inauguration ceremonies for the new president of Samford University after students protested his involvement with Planned Parenthood. Representatives for Samford University did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment, nor did Meacham’s book publicist. President Beck Taylor wrote in a letter to the university community on Oct. 27 that due to objections, including from “elements of Samford’s Student Government Association,” the “Soul of America” author will be rescheduled “at a more appropriate time to an event not so closely connected to the symbolism of the inauguration,” as first reported by Baptist News Global. “This recommendation simultaneously recognizes the potential distraction the event may cause from next week’s celebrations and the importance of free expression and the exchange of ideas,” Taylor continued. Meacham — 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner for a biography about President Andrew Jackson and author of works about Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt and George H.W. Bush — was invited to speak at an event on Nov. 3 to honor the university’s new president and reflect on the importance of civil discourse, according to the university. A student started a Change.org petition to “Prevent Jon Meacham from speaking at [an] inauguration event for Dr. Beck Taylor,” citing Meacham’s involvement in Planned Parenthood as a conflict with the school’s values. “Jon Meacham is significantly involved with the Planned Parenthood organization. He has spoken at their fundraising events, his book is used for the Planned Parenthood fundraiser, and overall his beliefs and core values do not align with those of Samford University, as it is a Southern Baptist institution,” the petition reads. “Mr. Meacham is involved with raising money in support of an organization that does not value life in the same way the Christian faith does. As Samford is the top-ranked Christian University in Alabama, the invitation for Mr. Meacham to speak is not only disappointing, but alarming for the future of Samford.” In a press release that announced Meacham’s invitation, the school described him as: “a skilled orator with a depth of knowledge about politics, religion and current affairs [who] brings historical context to the issues and events impacting our daily lives.” In an email obtained by Baptist News Global, Taylor told students that Meacham’s original invitation to Samford wasn’t a reflection of any university position on abortion. He also said that Meacham wasn’t planning to speak about abortion. “It has come to our attention that Mr. Meacham has previously spoken at a Planned Parenthood chapter event,” Taylor wrote. “Some in our community have assumed erroneously that Samford’s invitation by extension endorses any perspectives or viewpoints Mr. Meacham may have about the sanctity of life and abortion rights. I can assure you that no such connection should be inferred. Mr. Meacham is not planning to discuss these issues in his remarks.” Taylor said he valued free expression and civil discourse at the university, but felt that moving forward with a Meacham appearance would take away from the purpose of the inauguration. “Our mission as a Christ-centered institution of higher learning is to stand boldly at the intersection of society and the church and to convene important conversations about how to live faithfully in the world,” he wrote. “That mission calls us to invite speakers and artists to campus who challenge our perspectives and who share wisdom and insights. Samford is a diverse community made up of faithful people who disagree on many important issues. Let’s enter those conversations courageously with a goal of learning from one another and extending the love of Christ to all. I believe we can do that well.” “Although I am disappointed by the narrative that has combined important conversations about pro-life issues and Mr. Meacham’s planned appearance at Samford, it is vitally important to me that next week’s events unify and draw our community together to celebrate the history and future of Samford University, a place we love and for which we all care deeply,” Taylor continued. “Unexpectedly, Mr. Meacham’s planned lecture has become a divisive issue, one that takes attention away from our opportunity to celebrate Samford.” In a statement obtained by AL.com Friday, a university official wrote, “Mr. Meacham, who is a noted historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential biographer, has been invited to our campus to highlight his work in analyzing the current state of civility and discourse in our country. We look forward to hosting him at a later date.”

President Joe Biden received Communion during Mass Saturday evening in Rome, according to a report from the Associated Press. Biden met with Pope Francis on Friday, during which, he says, Pope Francis told him to “keep receiving Communion,” despite his views on abortion. According to the A.P., about 30 people attended the Mass at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, which had a large security presence. The president and his wife sat in the last row. The report stated that Mass was celebrated by Father Joe Ciccone and two concelebrating priests, and that Biden was seen putting U.S. currency in the collection basket. “Communion is what brings us together in the Lord. None of us are pure and perfect. We struggle through life. We’re all saints and sinners,” the celebrant, Father Joe Ciccone, told the A.P. “When you’re a public figure you have to make certain decisions, especially in a democracy, on behalf of more than just your own personal feelings,” Ciccone said. St. Patrick’s Church is located near the U.S. Embassy, and is the main place of worship for many Americans in Rome. The church, which is within the pope’s archdiocese, offers all Masses in English. It is the same church Nancy Pelosi attended when she visited Pope Francis earlier this month. Pelosi and her husband left Mass on Oct. 9, before the second reading because of a security incident. Biden is in Rome for the G20 Heads of State and Government Summit. He met with Pope Francis for 75 minutes on Friday, during which they did not discuss abortion, Biden told reporters afterward. Biden said that he and the pope prayed for each other and discussed climate change. “We just talked about the fact that he was happy I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving Communion,” Biden said. Unlike past meetings between the pope and a head of state, the Vatican did not allow media to be present when Biden and Pope Francis met. No video live stream was provided. Biden, the second American Catholic to become president, has supported taxpayer-funded abortion during his first year in office, and has issued statements in defense of legal abortion, sparking calls by some bishops and other Catholics to bar him from receiving the Eucharist.

According to AL.com, the decision came after students held a protest to share their grievances about Meacham speaking. When Meacham's visit was initially announced, the university described him as a ""'skilled orator with a depth of knowledge about politics, religion and current affairs,' and referenced work that 'examines the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in U.S. history when hope overcame division and fear,'"" the publication reports. However, students argued otherwise. In fact, one student questioned his ability to speak at the event due to his recent appearance at a Planned Parenthood event that was recently held in Texas. In her petition submitted to university officials, Emily Kirby wrote, ""His beliefs and core values do not align with those of Samford University, as it is a Southern Baptist institution."" She added, ""Mr. Meacham is involved with raising money in support of an organization that does not value life in the same way the Christian faith does.

2021-10-30	20:38:44+00:00	Samantha Woodward | swoodward@pioneerpress.com | St. Paul Pioneer Press	twincities	Supreme Court will tackle abortion rights. What does it mean for Minnesota?	https://www.twincities.com/2021/10/30/supreme-court-will-tackle-abortion-rights-what-does-it-mean-for-minnesota/	The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in response to a recent Texas abortion law. In December, they will hear a Mississippi case that could decide the fate of Roe v. Wade. As the nation prepares for potential landmark decisions on abortion rights, Minnesota legislators and advocates are gearing up for the possible precedents the court could set. Regardless of how the court rules there would be little immediate impact on Minnesota because of safeguards put in place to protect rights to abortion. In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States established the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. It continues to be a hot political issue to this day. The Texas Heartbeat Act was signed in May and prohibits abortions after a heartbeat is detected, around six weeks. No government officer or agency is permitted to enforce the law according to the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. The new Texas law allows private citizens to sue a person seeking to receive, perform or assist in any process of an abortion. The person suing can get up to $10,000 per abortion provided or aided. There is no limit on how many people can sue for the same abortion. Laura Hermer, professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said that a law that “deputizes citizens” is unprecedented. In September, the Supreme Court heard whether or not to block the Heartbeat Act. The majority of the court refused to block the law and it was put into effect. The cases being heard Monday will challenge the Texas law’s constitutionality. A person is able to get an abortion up to 28 weeks in Minnesota. The state has enacted several requirements for undergoing an abortion, such as: In 2020, there were 9,108 induced abortions in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Health. The year before, there were 9,922. Federally, abortions are protected by Roe v. Wade. Statewide, they are protected by the 1995 case Doe v. Gomez. In that case, the Minnesota Supreme Court established a wide-ranging right to abortions based on its interpretation of the Minnesota Constitution’s privacy rights. Because of this, even if Roe is overturned, people in Minnesota would still be able to get abortions. No one has proposed a Texas-style law in Minnesota. In the political reality, any major restrictions on abortion would have little chance of becoming law without a Republican sweep in the 2022 elections. Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life Executive Director Scott Fischbach said that anti-abortion advocates in Minnesota are encouraged by the law. “We hope this to be a very pivotal time here,” he said. Fischbach said that regardless of the outcome of the Texas law, anti-abortion Minnesotans will continue to fight. The advocacy group works with lawmakers to restrict abortions in the state. State Rep. Marion O’Neill, R-Maple Lake, has co-sponsored a bill that would ban abortion after a detected heartbeat, as the one in Texas does. It has seen little progress in the Minnesota Legislature. She has also sponsored a bill that would prevent the use of taxpayer money for abortions. That bill has been introduced in multiple sessions and been shot down. If passed, it would directly contradict the decision in Doe v. Gomez that ensures patients receiving taxpayer-funded medical assistance have access to abortion care. “It’s a very difficult path,” O’Neill said. To her knowledge, she said, neither she nor her Republican colleagues in the Legislature are working to introduce a bill that “deputizes citizens” to enforce anti-abortion law. “But you know, what if it pans out in the Supreme Court?” she said. “Who knows.” Abortion rights advocates were shocked when they heard about the Texas law. They too are gearing up for a fight and are pushing to ease some of the restrictions in place in Minnesota. “I think it’s one thing to be pro-life and it’s another thing to have a bounty hunter system for regular citizens to turn other people in,” said Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul. “The lawyer in me says that is a terrible precedent to set.” In September, Hollins and a number of her fellow Democrats in the Legislature started the Reproductive Freedom Caucus and organizers have called for increased public support and dismantling of restrictive abortion laws. Hollins said she and her colleagues are excited to open a space for abortion care conversations but are realistic about the challenges a divided Legislature brings. Removing restrictions on abortion is a top priority for the tentative agenda. Hollins said the ultimate plan is to codify Roe v. Wade in law. Previous proposals to do so have not succeeded. Erin May Quade, a state Senate candidate and current advocacy director at Gender Justice, said she was not surprised. “We are preparing Minnesota for a post-Roe world, and in a post-Roe world, we still have constitutional rights to abortion in Minnesota,” May Quade said. May Quade, an advocate working with the Reproductive Freedom Caucus, said that Minnesota voters are not split on the issue of abortion, but “the Minnesota Legislature is out of step.” “The Minnesota public is highly supportive of people being able to make decisions about abortion care without the government interfering,” she said. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson and United States v. Texas. Both challengers claim the Texas Heartbeat Act directly contradicts Roe v. Wade and is unconstitutional. They said it was written to avoid judicial review by putting the enforcement on the citizens and not the government. The question before the court is simple, said Hermer: To what extent will the court allow a state’s legislature to allow unconstitutional acts through a procedural loophole? Hermer said that “if (the Texas law) was allowed to stand, (legislatures could enact similar laws) if they wanted to, and they could with respect to just about any other constitutional liberty that we presently enjoy.” The justices will hear arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in December. The separate case challenges a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, directly challenging the protected rights to abortion from Roe v. Wade. Dave Orrick contributed to this report. As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

2021-10-30	19:49:56+00:00	Associated Press |	pe	Biden: Pope told me that I should ‘keep receiving Communion’	https://www.pe.com/2021/10/30/biden-pope-told-me-that-i-should-keep-receiving-communion/	By JOSH BOAK, ZEKE MILLER and NICOLE WINFIELD ROME (AP) — Face to face at the Vatican, President Joe Biden held extended and highly personal talks with Pope Francis on Friday and came away saying the pontiff told him he was a “good Catholic” and should keep receiving Communion, although conservatives have called for him to be denied the sacrament because of his support for abortion rights. The world’s two most prominent Roman Catholics ran overtime in their discussions on climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic, a warm conversation that also touched on the loss of president’s adult son and included jokes about aging well. Biden said abortion did not come up in the meeting. “We just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving Communion,” Biden said. The president’s support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. American bishops are due to meet in their annual fall conference in mid-November, and will find themselves debating a possible rebuke of a U.S. president just weeks after their boss spent so much time with Biden that all their subsequent meetings were thrown off by an hour. Video released by the Vatican showed several warm, relaxed moments between Francis and Biden as they repeatedly shook hands and smiled. Francis often sports a dour look, especially in official photos, but he seemed in good spirits Friday. The private meeting lasted about 75 minutes, according to the Vatican, more than double the normal length of an audience with the pontiff, The pair sat across from each other at a desk in the papal library, accompanied by a translator. They then proceeded to an exchange of gifts and a broader meeting including the first lady and top officials. “Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution,” the White House said. “He lauded Pope Francis’ leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery.” Biden takes pride in his Catholic faith, using it as a moral guidepost to shape his social and economic policies. He wears a rosary and attends Mass weekly. After leaving the Vatican, Biden said that he had a “wonderful” meeting and that the pope prayed for him and blessed his rosary beads. He said the prayer was about “peace.” A dozen Swiss Guards in their blue and gold striped uniforms and red-plumed helmets stood at attention in the San Damaso courtyard as Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived. They were received by Monsignor Leonardo Sapienza, who runs the papal household, and then greeted one by one the papal ushers, or papal gentlemen, who lined up in the courtyard. “It’s good to be back,” Biden said as he shook the hand of one of them. “I’m Jill’s husband,” he told another before he was ushered into the frescoed Apostolic Palace and taken upstairs to the pope’s private library. According to the Vatican, Biden presented Francis with a woven chasuble, or liturgical vestment, made in 1930 by the famed papal tailor Gammarelli and used by the pope’s Jesuit order in the U.S., where it was held in the archives of Holy Trinity Church, Biden’s regular parish in Washington. The White House said it would make a donation to charity in the pope’s name. Biden also slipped what’s known as a challenge coin into the pope’s palm during a handshake, and hailed Francis as “the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met.” The personalized coin depicts Biden’s home state of Delaware and a reference to his late son Beau’s military unit, the 261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade. Biden told Francis that Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, would have wanted him to present the coin to the pope. “The tradition is, and I’m only kidding about this, but next time I see you, if you don’t have it, you have to buy the drinks,” Biden said, referring to the coin. He added: “I’m the only Irishman you’ve ever met who’s never had a drink.” Francis laughed and responded: “The Irish brought whiskey.” Biden, 78, also relayed the story of American baseball player Satchel Paige, a Black pitcher who played late into his fifties, in a parable about aging. “’How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you were?” Biden quoted Paige as saying. “You’re 65, I’m 60,” Biden added, as Francis, 84, pointed to his head and laughed. Francis presented Biden with a ceramic tile depicting the iconography of the pilgrim, as well as a collection of the pope’s main teaching documents, the Vatican said. In the Vatican video, he could be heard asking Jill Biden to “pray for me.” The warm encounter stood in stark contrast to Donald Trump’s 2017 meeting with Francis, with whom the former president had a prickly relationship. Photos from that 30-minute meeting showed a stone-faced Francis standing beside a grinning Trump. Biden’s meeting also was longer than the 52 minutes Barack Obama spent with Francis in 2014. Biden is visiting Rome and then Glasgow for back-to-back summits, first a gathering for leaders of the Group of 20 leading and developing nations and then a global climate conference. Biden and Francis have previously met three times, but Friday’s encounter was their first since Biden became president. Biden also met separately Friday with G-20 summit hosts Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He ended the day with French President Emmanuel Macron, trying anew to smooth relations after the U.S. and U.K. decided to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, scotching a lucrative French contract in the process. Biden’s meeting with Pope Francis generated some controversy in advance as the Vatican on Thursday abruptly canceled plans to broadcast the meeting with Biden live and denied independent press access. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the revised television plan reflected the virus protocol for all heads of state audiences, though he didn’t say why more robust live TV coverage had been initially scheduled and then canceled. The Vatican instead provided edited footage of the encounter to accredited media. The Vatican spokesman declined to comment on Biden’s remarks about Communion, noting that the Vatican doesn’t comment on the pope’s private conversations beyond what is written in the official communique, which made no mention of the issue. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement after the Vatican meeting that didn’t address Biden’s remark about Communion. Instead, the statement suggested that the president would not be singled out in any document emerging from the bishops’ meeting next month. The document “is intended to speak to the beauty of meeting Jesus Christ in the Eucharist and is addressed to all Catholics,” the statement said. There was no immediate response to queries sent by The Associated Press to seven bishops engaged in the debate. Francis has stressed that he will not reject political leaders who support abortion rights, though Catholic policy allows individual bishops to choose whether to prevent people from taking Communion.

We've received your submission. President Biden received communion in Rome Saturday, as battles over abortion continue to rage in the US. Biden and his wife Jill joined about 30 parishioners at St. Patrick’s Church, which ministers to Americans in Rome, between sessions of the ongoing Group of 20 summit. They sat in the last row of a roped-off section of pews and chipped into the offertory basket with a donation of US currency. Biden’s Mass attendance came one day after a 90-minute private meeting with the Pope that reporters were barred from attending. Afterward, Biden said the subject of abortion — which Francis has defined as “murder” and has likened to “hiring a hitman” — had not come up in their discussion. “We just talked about the fact that he was happy I’m a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,” Biden said. The Vatican would not confirm his account, which a papal spokesman said had been “a private conversation.” Biden, a lifelong Catholic, regularly attends Mass and receives the sacrament in his home dioceses in Delaware and Washington, DC — but has come under fire from conservative members of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops for his administration’s support for taxpayer abortion funding and its court battles with states like Texas that seek to restrict it. The conference voted in June to draft a “teaching document” that could deny communion to Biden and other Catholic politicians who have broken with the church’s abortion doctrines. Under canon law, each bishop has the power to enforce such rules within his own diocese.

It also means patients who are stressed over missing many days of work or finding lodging or maneuvering the long trip out-of-state with children in tow, and without the support system they may have had back home. “We’re dealing with both a much higher volume and with patients who are in crisis at a much higher rate,” Emily Wales, interim president & CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told TPM. And while the states near Texas may not have the draconian six-week ban that the Supreme Court allowed to stand before it hears the case, many are still hostile to abortion rights. Oklahoma requires an ultrasound and 72-hour waiting period. Kansas has a 24-hour waiting period and both private insurance (without an additionally purchased rider) and plans in the state’s health exchange only cover the procedure in cases of life endangerment. Arkansas has a 72-hour waiting period that only begins after an in-person, state-directed counseling session aimed at dissuading the patient from having the abortion. And all of those states are actively trying to pass more restrictions. That leaves what few abortion providers have thus far survived years of onslaught from Republican-led legislatures with an enormous, double-pronged task: to cope with the droves of patients coming from Texas while preparing as best they can for attempts to further restrict abortion rights made with renewed vigor in their own states. “We’re in a trial run for a post-Roe world right now,” Jessie Hill, associate dean and professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told TPM. Clinics in Texas’ neighboring states, already few in number due to sustained state-level efforts to heap restrictions upon them, are being overrun with patients further along than the six week threshold currently allowed under state law. That’s before many women know they’re pregnant, and precludes 85 to 90 percent of procedures done in Texas, according to lawyers for the clinics in court documents. “We saw over 300 Texans last month just in our Oklahoma facilities,” Wales said. “We saw just a little more than that throughout all of last year.” “In August of this year, we saw one Texas patient in our Wichita clinic. In September, we saw 51,” Zack Gingrich-Gaylord, interim communication director at Trust Women, which has clinics in Oklahoma City and Wichita, told TPM. The influx is being acutely felt in services that orbit the providers too. Fund Texas Choice is a non-profit organization that helps subsidize the costs associated with obtaining an abortion: travel, lodging, meals. “We funded an average of $400 per client before SB 8,” Sarah, Fund Texas Choice’s manager of programs, told TPM of the six-week abortion law. “We’ve seen an increase in more high-dollar clients who cost more money to stay longer and travel further,” she said, pegging the new price tags at “$700, $800, $1,000.” (Sarah asked that TPM not use her last name, out of security concerns since the law’s passage. SB 8 threatens all who “aid and abet” an abortion in Texas past six weeks with criminal liability, and has deputized individuals to turn those people in, creating a legion of, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it, “bounty hunters.” Those individuals get a $10,000 reward for a successful suit and legal fees recouped; defendants get nothing if the suit fails.) Prior to the influx of Texans, Sarah handled client work by herself. Fund Texas Choice has since had to scale up its staff. But, for abortion-adjacent organizations, boosting staff presents its own challenges. “It’s difficult to hire for abortion care in this area — not because there aren’t great people, but because the stigma makes it difficult for people to even seek this employment out,” Gingrich-Gaylord said. “Also, there’s a little ongoing pandemic, so health care is tough sell.” While these clinics and orbiting services are trying to bulk up to handle the increased need, they’re also navigating a patchwork of restrictive state laws, including new ones which could shut them down or limit their resources — often at a moment’s notice. Oklahoma has multiple laws caught up in litigation at the moment. The state Supreme Court just temporarily blocked three of them: one would have required all abortion providers in the state to be board-certified OB/GYNs, and the other two restrict abortions induced by medication. A lawyer for clinics in the lawsuit said that the OB/GYN provision alone would disqualify over half of the providers in the state; many are family medicine practitioners. An Oklahoma judge had previously temporarily blocked two other laws, one of which would ban abortion after six weeks. So far, the relief is only short-term, pending further rulings. In neighboring Arkansas, a state lawmaker has already drafted a Texas copycat law, and plans to introduce it in a legislative special session. In a mark of how hostile the surrounding terrain is, Gingrich-Gaylord considers Kansas the current “safe state.” “Our Kansas problems don’t happen until next year,” he said. “There’s an amendment ballot proposal next year to remove the state’s constitutional right to abortion.” All of these are just skirmishes compared to the primary theater: the United States Supreme Court. The Court is hearing the Texas law on an expedited timeline, though it may avoid ruling on its constitutionality. While the survival of the Texas law would certainly encourage more copycats in Republican-majority states, it pales in comparison to a 15-week ban out of Mississippi that will force the Court to rule directly on its constitutionality and potentially upend Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. “This is all in the shadow of the Dobbs case,” Case Western Law’s Hill said of Missippi’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Abortion providers in red states are by definition beleagured, for years subject to attack by state laws and wearily accustomed to navigating the stops and starts of litigation as courts uphold these laws, block them, or strike them down. But even those used to the bellicose rhythms are feeling a tempo change now. “This is the moment,” Hill said. “Everything’s on the line right now.” 
2021-10-30	12:30:12+00:00	Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards |	The Mercury News	Editorial: Texas abortion law would recreate Wild West law enforcement	https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/30/editorial-stop-texas-abortion-laws-return-to-wild-west-enforcement/	The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday on whether to allow a Justice Department suit to proceed against Texas’ near ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The final outcome is pivotal not only to women’s basic right to an abortion but also to sanctioning an unwelcome new era of citizen law enforcement. The Texas law empowers private citizens, rather than the government, to enforce the ban. It allows private citizens to bring civil litigation against providers or anyone who helps a woman access an abortion after six weeks. The $10,000 bounty creates a Wild West approach to law enforcement that will only further widen the nation’s political divide. The Supreme Court must stop the Texas law in its tracks before state legislatures start writing similar laws on other hot-button political issues, including gun control, free speech and gay rights. The law is already having a chilling effect. Planned Parenthood Mar Monte provides reproductive health and primary care services to more than 220,000 men, women and children every year at 35 health centers throughout the Bay Area, mid-California and northern Nevada. It is already experiencing an influx of patients who cannot access an abortion in Texas or neighboring states whose clinics are scrambling to keep pace with the demand. The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center based in New York and Washington that supports abortion rights, issued a report Thursday on the expected impact if the court weakens or overturns Roe vs. Wade. The report anticipates that 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion, including the Western states of Idaho, Utah and Arizona. The report said that California could expect a 3,000% increase, equal to 1.4 million women of reproductive age (15-49), who would likely drive to California for abortion care. It presents a daunting challenge for California providers who, like other health care operations in the state, are already dealing with staff burnout due to the impact of COVID-19. One other unintended consequence of the Texas law is the prospect of states that ban abortions creating a generation of clinicians without the skill set to deal with medical issues related to abortions. Legal experts have also warned that the law could be used by lawmakers — both conservative and liberal — to try to circumvent Supreme Court rulings they don’t like. The Firearms Policy Coalition, a non-profit organization fighting against gun control laws, has issued a court brief warning that states such as California and New York could use the law to adopt “equally aggressive gambits to not merely chill but to freeze the right to keep and bear arms.” Vigilante style law enforcement is not the solution to America’s challenges. And overturning Roe vs. Wade won’t stop abortions from taking place. It will only make them more unsafe for millions of American women. The Wild West model of law enforcement encouraged vigilantism at its worst. The court should stop the Texas law before it unleashes a new era of citizens taking the law into their own hands.
2021-10-30	10:00:00+00:00	Unknown	ZimEye	Unprotected S_X In Bulawayo Vuzu Parties	https://www.zimeye.net/2021/10/30/unprotected-s_x-in-bulawoyo-vuzu-parties/	By A Correspondent- A study has revealed that there could be rampant backyard abortions by desperate teenagers who indulge in risky sexual activities during Vuzu parties in Bulawayo. The study entitled ‘Exploring the practice of Vuzus among young people in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe was conducted by Aids Healthcare Foundation (AFH) in partnership with Grassroot Soccer (GRS). A total of 122 young people were recruited into the study, all drawn from different areas in Bulawayo and the youngest being 15 and the oldest being 24 years old.Of those, 77 were female and 45 were males. Some said they participate in Vuzu parties just to trend on social media and gain popularity.Findings show that absenteeism of parents and guardians often lead them to participate in the parties.The parties are characterised by alcohol and drug use, sexual activity and usually in secretive gatherings by young people although there are adults who are always keen to provide the venue, drugs and alcohol so that they can take advantage of young girls.Drugs used include cocaine, meth, lack widow, marijuana, weed cakes, shisha and cough syrup. The parties are commonly referred to as booze, naked party, orgy party, pool party, rave, emasofeni, turn up, cashtime, get together and house party.Teenagers in Bulawayo are known to organise these drugs and alcohol-fuelled parties where they engage in sex marathons and other risky behaviours oblivious of the dangers, they put their lives in including unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections like HIV.Respondents highlighted that during sex marathons, condoms are not used leaving them at a risk of contracting STIs and falling pregnant.The get-togethers, which are known as Vuzu parties although the source of that word is unknown, often lead to unprotected sex and anti-social behaviour.Speaking during the launch of the findings of the study GRS country manager Mr Bekimpilo Moyo said Vuzu parties appear to be very common in Bulawayo although the extent to which they have persisted through Covid-19 restrictions remains unknown.He said a majority of those who attend indicated that they had attended the parties many times ranging from five to 50 times. “Drug and alcohol abuse are defining characteristics of Vuzu parties and many young people say they partake in order to have fun. Drugs used include cocaine, meth, black widow, marijuana, weed cakes, shisha, cough syrup among others,” said Mr Moyo.He said they also noted with concern that extreme power dynamics were at play as respondents said older male attendees provide younger female participants with drugs and alcohol to lower their inhibitions and make them lose control.“Sex workers also attend Vuzu parties and one respondent highlighted that she engaged in transactional sex at Vuzu parties,” said Mr Moyo.Motivating factors for attendance include peer influence and seeking outlets to relieve stress emanating from home as well as an opportunity to engage in sexual activity.“There are also concerns about the future consequences of the heavy drinking and drug use at Vuzu parties. One youth respondent noted that his greatest regret of attending the parties was addiction and that some of the girls fell pregnant during the marathons forcing them to conduct abortions with the help of older women as they did not even know who was responsible for the pregnancies.”He said Vuzu parties are also deemed as an outlet for stress relief from socio-economic problems at home.Young people also reported that they attend the parties to make money, either through selling drugs or transactional sex. “When asked about times that they were invited to a Vuzu party but did not attend, youth respondents gave a variety of responses, falling largely into two categories. Curfew or parents being present at home was one reported barrier as well as a lack of transport or pending house chores,” said Mr Moyo.Some respondents indicated that they lacked money to attend, or that they didn’t have proper clothes to fit in at the party.“Young people recommend that parents, older residents, police and church leaders should lead a campaign to address Vuzu parties with religious leaders providing spiritual guidance to young people. Using the police to suppress such parties could potentially save a lot of young people from the disastrous effects of Vuzu parties,” said Mr Moyo.He said other young people requested for risk reduction approaches to Vuzu parties making them safer places with condoms readily available which would make these parties cooler spaces to chill.Young people further suggested that such parties change venues from secretive to public places and from nights to afternoons.AHF foundation country programme manager Dr Ernest Chikwati said the study was meant to ascertain what was fuelling the parties, age groups involved and the activities associated. He said Vuzu parties were not a Bulawayo phenomenon as they are being conducted countrywide but with different names.“We have discovered that these parties are quite prevalent and it is not only youths who attend sex parties but also adults who are hungry to take advantage of adolescents. Some said they can sleep with five to 10 people per day and its unprotected sex which is very risky,” said Dr Chikwati.He said there was a need to look at how to address this as youths were saying they do not have enough entertainment and sports facilities where they can have fun.“We need to revive Ubuntu in the community where we are all responsible for the wellbeing of every child. We have people who do not care to report that Vuzu parties are being held near or next to them,” said Dr Chikwati.He said going forward, an all-stakeholders meeting will be held to form a committee that will ensure the issue of Vuzu parties is addressed.“These parties fuel HIV transmission as stated by respondents who say they can have sex marathons without the use of condoms. We need to come together as stakeholders, communities and even politicians and tackle this scourge,” said Dr Chikwati. Bulawayo provincial Aids coordinator Mrs Sinatra Nyathi said the study was an eye opener for the community especially parents and guardians who must play their part to protect the adolescents.“We are grateful to our partners who helped us conduct this research and it is clear that these parties are prevalent in the city. As Bulawayo we will unite to come up with a way forward and engage churches, media, parents and all our partner organisations to tackle this challenge,” said Mrs Nyathi.She highlighted the need to give adolescents a chance to speak out without judgment so that relevant interventions are crafted.“HIV infections are still rife, these Vuzu parties have also fuelled pregnancies leading to backyard abortions and this leads to maternal deaths.

Kaitlyn Lavo, Staff PhotographerOctober 29, 2021 This photo essay is the visually focused version of our written piece on the Oct. 2 women’s marches across Los Angeles. To read the written piece click here. Crowds gathered on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and North Hollywood on Oct. 2 to march in solidarity for the women of Texas. The marches were in response to the Texas abortion law that passed on Sept. 1. For the Women’s March in downtown Los Angeles, thousands of participants covered the streets in a sea of pro-choice imagery. Volunteers passed out water bottles to participants walking from Pershing Square to City Hall on the warm October day. Feminist speakers from all sectors stood on a large stage to address the crowd and media who were seated in metal risers parallel to the stage. Dr. Stephen Rabin, a obstetrics and gynecology specialist, organized a sign holding rally in Beverly Hills. Messages advocating for reproductive rights were held high for cars passing by the iconic Beverly Hills arched sign. The handmade signs from the participants were held to send direct messages in hopes the federal government would intervene. All three demonstrations provided space for those to express their feelings toward the Texas abortion law. Speakers such as Paxton Smith and Gloria Allred spoke at the downtown Los Angeles and Beverly Hills demonstrations. Smith, who was a valedictorian at Lake Highlands High School in Texas, made an impromptu speech that caught the nation’s attention. Allred is a feminist lawyer who advocates for victims whose rights have been violated. She has been fighting against injustice and fighting for women and minorities’ rights for the last four decades. Allred is most well known for her work representing Norma McCorvey — also known as Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade — and the family of Nicole Brown Simpson in the O.J. Simpson murder trial. “Before Roe v. Wade, doctor’s hands were tied by belief-based legislation, and they were not allowed to provide abortions. Patients had to take it into their own hands, and as a result, thousands of women died. We cannot, we will not, go back to the days when the only way to end the pregnancy is to risk our lives … we are not vessels for reproduction, we are human beings, and it’s time that we get treated like it,” Smith said, “The principles of this nation are freedom, liberty and equality. When a government oversteps its bounds, when a government turns its back on those principles, we will not stay silent about it.” Though there were no stages or sound systems, the voices of the North Hollywood demonstrators echoed throughout Vineland Avenue. Although the crowd was not as large as the demonstration in downtown Los Angeles, the energy was equally met. There was a sense of unity among North Hollywood’s march for reproductive rights. The people who marched the streets not only continued to spread the message of the day but the smaller crowd size — which reached close to 500 participants — allowed for more community interaction. People who have never met before shared personal stories and discussed the effects of the Texas abortion law. Turmoil grows over California’s student vaccination requirement.

2021-10-29	22:58:11+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	alternet	How the Texas abortion law’s faulty legal text could self-destruct	https://www.alternet.org/2021/10/texas-abortion-laws/	"The ghastliness of the new Texas abortion law is difficult to express in words. It prevents women from aborting their pregnancies after six weeks and creates legal avenues for the punishment of those who assist a woman in her efforts to obtain an abortion. Texas has opened a multidimensional Pandora's box that threatens marginalized communities across the country. A future without Roe v. Wade has been thrown more sharply into focus. The emergence of abortion bounties in Texas begs the questions of where else these bounties might be collected and which other constitutional rights may be subject to vigilantism. The Supreme Court, which now has a decisive conservative majority, refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the new law. Many have described the Supreme Court's decision as both secretive and ""cowardly"" for its arrival in the dead of night and with minimal explanation. Whatever the label may be, the decision by the Supreme Court has left American women within Texas and throughout the country more vulnerable than they were just a few months ago. While lawyers may be responsible for constructing the Texas abortion law, lawyers may also be best positioned to thwart its aims even as it remains good law. The Texas law permits abortion bounty hunters to sue those who ""knowingly [engage] in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion."" A $10,000 bounty at a minimum awaits successful plaintiffs on the other side of litigation. Navigating lawsuits requires meeting deadlines, responding to motions, submitting discovery requests, advancing legal arguments, and understanding rules of civil procedure and evidence. Such complex tasks, which must be completed in order to succeed, will undoubtedly require legal representation. Crucially, however, because the lawsuits are challenged in civil court, plaintiffs have no constitutional right to free legal representation. Abortion bounty hunters seeking their bounties will turn to private attorneys in Texas for legal assistance. Principled lawyers throughout the state should decline to take these cases. Lawyers who refuse to represent abortion bounty hunters could mitigate the harms specifically prevented by abortion bounties without having to wait for the legislative process or the judicial process to work. The calculus is simple: Abortion bounty hunters who are rebuffed over and over again may eventually decline to litigate. Those who decide to represent themselves are far less likely to be successful in court. If this practice is carried out successfully by lawyers, it might serve as a deterrent for those inclined to engage in abortion bounty hunting. Some may argue that this proposal is unethical and unprecedented in itself. On the contrary, this is simply lawyering. Discretion is inherent in the legal profession. Lawyers decline cases consistently. Personal ethics can factor into those decisions. Furthermore, there is a precedent for selective lawyering. At the dawn of the civil rights movement, civil rights lawyers meticulously selected cases that they thought would be best suited to challenging racial segregation and discrimination. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which led the legal assault on racial disparities during the movement, strategically confronted school desegregation, from Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada to Brown v. Board of Education, believing that deconstructing this form of racism was necessary to unsettling state-sanctioned discrimination. Just as the civil rights movement called for lawyering that could be dynamic, aggressive, and persistent in taking cases, responding to the political moment created by the Texas abortion law may call for the same kind of lawyering in declining cases. To be sure, there are other, perhaps more conventional, efforts underway to oppose the Texas law. The Department of Justice challenged the constitutionality of the Texas law in federal court on October 18. While the Supreme Court again refused to ""immediately block"" the Texas law, it could take months for this case to wind its way through a federal docket and reach a final conclusion. Congressional Democrats are working to protect abortion rights with legislation, but, with the pace at which federal legislation progresses, such a bill could take years before it even comes to a vote in Congress. There is no guarantee that after the 2022 midterm elections Democrats will even be in a position to usher such legislation through Congress. Polling on the Democrats' chances of retaining control of Congress at this point certainly does not give the party much to be excited about. Furthermore, as a corollary, there is no guarantee that a Democratic president would occupy the White House to sign such a bill into law after 2024. Each of those avenues is premised on the luxury of time. The harms of the Texas law could spread in the meantime. Countless women are being deprived of their constitutional right to abort their pregnancies. Indeed, some Texas facilities that perform abortions temporarily stopped performing abortions altogether out of fear of the legal liability that they could incur as a result of the law. Fear could also prevent women from seeking abortions in the first place out of concern that they might expose their families and friends to legal jeopardy. And while the law brings fear to some, it could bring profit to others—abortion bounty hunters who stand to earn millions of dollars off of Texas women, their loved ones, and anyone who (knowingly or unknowingly) helps them obtain an abortion. Other states could adopt similar schemes. Republican officials in Arkansas, Florida, and South Dakota have expressed interest in using the Texas abortion law as a model for new abortion legislation in their states. Lawyers who decline to represent abortion bounty hunters have the power of relative immediacy on their side. Undoubtedly, there will be those who want to pursue abortion bounties, so there will also be lawyers who will help them do so. Lawyers who refuse to help plaintiffs collect abortion bounties, should similarly be prepared to help defendants pro bono. The new abortion law will most directly harm low-income women and women of color. Because those who are likely to help facilitate a woman's abortion will inevitably be members of her social network, they are also likely to be in the same socioeconomic bracket due to social forces like redlining and intergenerational poverty. Even those who may help a woman get an abortion without knowing her, like rideshare drivers, are likely to be low-income as well. In other words, the burden of this law will fall most heavily on some of the most vulnerable Texans. These defendants would have the hardest time affording legal representation and the most to lose financially if they are legally required to pay bounties. Indeed, what makes the abortion law so insidious is that it leverages economic inequities to frighten women into maintaining unwanted pregnancies and intimidates those who would otherwise help them. Representing these defendants pro bono could simultaneously strike a blow for abortion rights and weaken the grip of classism. The cruelty of situating the battle for abortion rights in the civil court system could lead to the downfall of the Texas abortion law. Because the success of the law effectively hinges on navigating the legal system, lawyers are best positioned to oppose it. They could single-handedly blunt the impact of the Texas law.

Instead of creating a new program administered by the federal government in the twelve states that refused to expand traditional Medicaid, the $1.75 trillion bill would close the so-called “Medicaid gap” by making lower-income individuals in those states eligible for Obamacare plans that are virtually cost-free. But other problems remain in the bill. As I explained the other day, elective abortions aren’t covered by Obamacare plans offered in these twelve states, but the reconciliation bill’s section regarding “family planning services” could require these new plans to cover abortions, unless abortion funding is prohibited. In the new 1,684-page reconciliation bill that Democrats released on Thursday, that section of the bill has been changed in a way that at least appears to attempt to exclude elective-abortion coverage — but actually fails to do so. “We see the change that was made,” says Autumn Christensen of the Susan B. Anthony List. “However, it was not drafted in a way that prevents an abortion mandate because it references the Medicaid statute — which does allow for abortion — instead of referencing Medicaid appropriations, which do not allow for abortion funding.” This issue is in the legislative weeds, but the point is important: The Hyde amendment, which prohibits Medicaid funding of abortion except in rare circumstances, must be attached each year to an appropriations bill that funds the program. The Hyde amendment is not permanently embedded in the underlying law that established Medicaid.* NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.

But if the final bill isn’t scrubbed of its provisions that could fund abortion, Democrats will be setting themselves up for a fight over taxpayer funding of abortion on the Senate floor. There are also “public health” grants in the reconciliation bill that could fund abortion. “Clearly these funds are not covered by the Hyde amendment,” says Christensen. The simplest way to ensure that the bill doesn’t fund abortion would be to explicitly include the text of the Hyde amendment in the bill — rather than cross-referencing legislation to which Hyde applies — but Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has said Democrats think that including it would be a “political statement.” At the same time, Jayapal has (incorrectly) claimed that “none of the dollars” in the reconciliation bill would be spent on elective abortion. So there’s no reason to believe that a bill that actually ensures “none of the dollars” would be spent on abortion would lose the vote of Jayapal or any of her followers. *Update: The Biden administration makes this very point that the statute authorizing Medicaid requires abortion coverage and only the appropriations bill funding Medicaid restricts taxpayer funding of abortion. Anne Marie Costello, Deputy Director for the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, explains the distinction between the Medicaid statute and Medicaid appropriations, as they relate to abortion funding, in a declaration filed in the case United States v. Texas—the case challenging the Texas Heartbeat Act. Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act also prohibits including abortion as an “essential benefit,” but the reconciliation bill notably does not add the aforementioned “family planning services” to that section of the Affordable Care Act.

Biden revealed the details of his lengthy talks with Francis as he was greeting Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in Rome.

Vatican Media/Handout via REUTERS ROME — U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that Pope Francis had told him he should keep receiving Communion, amid fierce debate in the U.S. Church over Biden’s position on abortion. Biden has come under pressure from conservatives at home and his most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy have said he should be banned from receiving communion, the central sacrament of the faith. Asked if the topic of abortion came up during a long meeting with the Pope in the Vatican earlier on Friday, Biden said no. He said the Pope told him he was happy he was a good Catholic and he should “keep receiving Communion.” The president, who goes to weekly Mass regularly and keeps a picture of the Pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. Last month, asked about the U.S. communion debate, Pope Francis told reporters that abortion is “murder.” But he also appeared to criticize U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way.

2021-10-29	19:27:21+00:00	Unknown	nationalpost	Biden says pope thinks he is a ‘good Catholic,’ further fueling U.S. abortion debate	https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/biden-says-pope-thinks-he-is-a-good-catholic-further-fueling-u-s-abortion-debate-3	VATICAN CITY — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that Pope Francis told him he was a “good Catholic” who can receive communion, widening a gulf between Francis and conservative U.S. bishops who want to deny it because of Biden’s support for abortion rights. Biden and the pope held an unusually long 1 hour and 15 minute meeting at the Vatican as a debate raged back in the United States about the divisive issue. Asked if the topic of abortion came up, Biden said: “No it didn’t. It came up — we just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,” Biden told reporters. The president, who goes to weekly Mass regularly and keeps a picture of the pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-bishops-vote-draft-communion-statement-that-may-rebuke-biden-abortion-views-2021-06-18 a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. They take up the issue again next month. But the pope’s comments to Biden, who disclosed them at the start of a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, may make it difficult for the bishops to follow through on their plans. Asked if he and the pope discussed the U.S. bishops, Biden said “that’s a private conversation.” Biden’s most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy doubled down ahead of the visit. “Dear Pope Francis, you have boldly stated that abortion is ‘murder’. Please challenge President Biden on this critical issue. His persistent support of abortion is an embarrassment for the Church and a scandal to the world,” Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, said on Twitter before the meeting. After the meeting, Tobin tweeted: “I fear that the Church has lost its prophetic voice. Where are the John the Baptists who will confront the Herods of our day?,” apparently comparing Biden to King Herod, who beheaded the preacher John for calling out the king’s sins. Last month, the pope told reporters that abortion is “murder” https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-says-abortion-is-murder-us-bishops-should-not-be-political-2021-09-15 but appeared to criticize U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way. “Communion is not a prize for the perfect. … Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,” the pope said, adding that bishops should use “compassion and tenderness” with Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. Since his election in 2013 as the first Latin American pope, Francis has said that while the Church should oppose abortion, the issue should not become an all-consuming battle in culture wars that detracts attention from matters such as immigration and poverty. Biden’s meeting with the pope came three days before the U.S. Supreme Court https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-challenge-texas-abortion-ban-2021-10-22 hears the first of two major cases this year challenging a series of state laws backed by Biden’s rival Republicans limiting abortion rights. Abortion opponents hope the court will overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs Wade decision that legalized the procedure nationwide. Both the White House and Vatican statements made no reference to the abortion issue. The White House said Biden thanked the pope for “his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution.” Biden also praised the pope’s “leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery.” The Vatican said the two discussed “care of the planet,” health care, the pandemic, refugees, migrants, and “the protection of human rights, including freedom of religion and conscience.” The Vatican said the private meeting lasted one hour and 15 minutes and then about another 15 minutes were spent for picture taking and the exchange of gifts in the presence of other members of the delegation, such as Biden’s wife, Jill. A meeting between the pope and former President Donald Trump in 2017 lasted about 30 minutes and one with Barrack Obama in 2014 lasted about 50 minutes. Biden gave the pope a coin sometimes awarded to soldiers and leaders and told him: “You are the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met.” A senior U.S. administration official said the two men discussed climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic at length.

2021-10-29	19:08:56+00:00	Unknown	nytimes	The History of Roe v. Wade, and the Texas Abortion Law	https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/opinion/roe-v-wade-texas-abortion-law.html	As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. Joshua Prager is the author of “The Family Roe: An American Story.” Before the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that abortion was legal in all 50 states, the case did nothing for the women of Texas, where it began. A federal panel in Dallas ruled that Texas’ anti-abortion laws were unconstitutional. But the panel was concerned about interfering in state affairs. And so although it granted doctors and women the legal right to perform and have abortions, they could still be prosecuted. “Apparently, we’re free to try them,” Dallas County’s District Attorney Henry Wade told the press, “so we’ll still do that.” Fearing the consequences, a hospital refused to abort the pregnancy of a 15-year-old girl who said she had been raped by her father. A half-century later, another court has refused to block the enforcement of another unconstitutional law that is, in effect, forcing Texas women to carry unwanted pregnancies. And on Monday, that court, the highest in the land, will hear oral arguments about that law — Texas’ Senate Bill 8, which deputizes private citizens to enforce a ban on abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they’re pregnant. The extremity of that law recalls what the majority opinion in Roe termed the “seemingly absolute convictions” that abortion inspires. But when Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote those words in 1973, that absolutism was largely contained. Though there were, of course, Americans — Catholics predominant among them — who opposed the legalization of abortion absolutely, the public reception of Roe was largely positive. For example, while a Wall Street Journal editorial wondered “whether the court stepped too far into the legislative arena,” it declared Roe “a reasonable balance on an exceedingly difficult question.” Most of the country moved on. From the time Roe was decided in January 1973 until year’s end, abortion clinics opened in 34 states, and at least 745,000 women reportedly had abortions in compliance with Roe — the procedure tax-deductible and covered by most insurance companies. When the Senate next convened to vet a potential Supreme Court justice, no one so much as asked the judge, John Paul Stevens, his opinion of Roe. Had they asked him, he likely would have answered honestly — something that’s impossible to do in such hearings today. People were generally much more open about Roe back then. They were openly conflicted about it, too, even its protagonists. Months after she filed Roe, the feminist lawyer Linda Coffee, who was a religious Baptist, confided her hope that abortion would become “sort of obsolete.” She added that while she did not believe the law ought to restrict abortion until the point of fetal viability, the standard established in the Roe decision, she “would have little personal sympathy for a woman who used abortion at any stage as contraception or to avoid personal responsibility.” The defendant Ms. Coffee named in Roe, Mr. Wade, the Dallas County district attorney, was secretly a liberal Democrat who, as his son Kim recalled to me, did not oppose legalizing abortion. And the plaintiff, Jane Roe, a Dallas waitress named Norma McCorvey, later campaigned against Roe after a religious rebirth. Even then, she privately felt that abortion ought to be legal through the first trimester — a position that she articulated to me from her hospital bed at the end of her life and that she first expressed to a Baptist news service days after Roe. “It’s hard to determine when human life begins,” she said in January 1973, in her very first media interview. “I wouldn’t want to wait over three months for any abortion, because I might be ending a human life after that time.” Activists on both sides of Roe had also agreed that choice and life had their limits. Dr. Mildred Jefferson, a surgeon and a future president of the National Right to Life Committee, publicly stated months after Roe was filed that she thought of herself as being less “against abortion” than “for the sanctity of life.” What upset her most was not abortion, she said, but that her fellow doctors were performing them. And at the time of Roe, Dr. Curtis Boyd of Texas, a committed Christian who is today among the largest providers of third-trimester abortions in the country, would perform no abortion past 16 weeks. The Roman Catholic Church also once drew a line there; it was at roughly 16 weeks that movement of the fetus was discernible, and in 1211, Pope Innocent III wrote that abortion could be ruled a homicide only if it terminated a pregnancy after this period of “quickening.” This canon law stipulated for all but three of the next 658 years, until 1869, when Pope Pius IX wrote in a papal bull that any woman who had an abortion would be censured. A priest and canon lawyer named Thomas Carr then determined (at the behest of the Irish church), that the pope had thus negated the distinction between abortions early and late. A 1917 papal codification of canon law agreed, and it was settled: The church would henceforth prohibit abortion from the moment of conception. The Bible, meanwhile, said nothing of abortion. And just as the pro-life were left to intuit its prohibition from Scripture, so were the pro-choice left to intuit its legality from the U.S. Constitution. Ms. Coffee initially suggested that the right to abortion might be grounded in any of six amendments. The Supreme Court settled on the 14th, ruling that its due process clause guaranteed a right to privacy, which in turn secured a right to abortion. That analysis has been assailed ever since, not least by feminists, including the future Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who believed that the right to abortion ought to be grounded not in privacy but in equality. Some critics of Roe thus dismiss it as jurisprudentially flawed. But some of their arguments against it are no more sure-footed, such as the contention that women who have abortions suffer from a form of post-traumatic stress called post-abortion syndrome. Though the medical community has debunked this syndrome — C. Everett Koop, the pro-life surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan, determined that the psychological toll of abortion on women was, from a public health perspective, “minuscule” — it is nonetheless expressly invoked in the Mississippi abortion law that the Supreme Court will rule on this term in deciding the fate of Roe. That law draws the line between legal and illegal abortion at 15 weeks; the Texas law draws it at six. Roe, of course, draws it at viability, the point at roughly 24 weeks when a fetus can survive outside the womb. That Roe constitutionalized viability owed in part to happenstance; only months before the 1973 ruling, a district judge in Connecticut became the first judge in the country to attach constitutional significance to viability, and several justices on the Supreme Court, including Lewis Powell and Potter Stewart, mentioned it to Justice Blackmun, who then inserted viability into his third and final draft of the Roe decision. Critics of Roe thus say that the viability threshold is arbitrary. But arbitrariness has marked the battle lines in Roe for decades. And it should not be politically disadvantageous to acknowledge that no matter how far along the 40 or so weeks from conception to birth, there is a philosophical argument that can be made to end a pregnancy or mandate its continuation. Abortion is fraught for good reason: The humanity of the fetus and the reasons a pregnant woman might want to abort it are both viable considerations. Not that long ago, Ms. McCorvey grappled with that clash. So did Mr. Wade and Ms. Coffee and Dr. Jefferson and Dr. Boyd and the Catholic Church. It is a dangerous thing when an issue that demands nuance comes instead to engender absolutes. It is a mark of polarization. And it has led our country exactly here — to a moment when a state has turned citizens against citizens in the hope of catching them exercising a right that has been constitutionally established for nearly 50 years.

2021-10-29	18:16:54+00:00	Unknown	nytimes	Biden: Pope Says He Should Keep Receiving Communion	https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/world/europe/biden-pope-communion-abortion.html	ROME — President Biden told reporters on Friday that Pope Francis had called him a “good Catholic” and said he should keep receiving communion, an unexpected development that appeared to put a papal finger on the scale in a debate raging in the United States’ Roman Catholic Church over whether the president and other Catholic politicians who support abortion rights should be denied the sacrament. In response to reporters who asked if Francis had told him during their private 75-minute audience at the Vatican whether he should keep receiving communion, Mr. Biden replied, “Yes.” Asked to confirm Mr. Biden’s remarks, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the Holy See limited its comments to the news release about subjects discussed during the meeting and added, “It’s a private conversation.” With summits of the world’s economic powers promising few concrete takeaways, the pope’s apparently explicit encouragement for Mr. Biden to continue taking communion could be one of the most tangible accomplishments that the president brings home. “A very strong choice,” said Alberto Melloni, a church historian in Rome, adding that he believed “the pope wanted people to know, and he wanted the American bishops not to take that path” toward denying Catholic politicians communion. But one conservative American bishop, Michael F. Olson of the Diocese of Fort Worth, Texas, questioned whether Mr. Biden’s account of the meeting was accurate. “The president is relating his version of events, which happen to serve his partisan agenda and seem a little self-aggrandizing,” he said. The Vatican — which did not allow public access to the meeting, citing coronavirus concerns — released heavily edited footage and later said in a statement that, in the private part of the meeting, Francis and Mr. Biden had focused “on the joint commitment to the protection and care of the planet, the health care situation and the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the theme of refugees and assistance to migrants.” It added that the talks had touched on human rights and freedom of religion. Before Mr. Biden’s meeting with Francis, leaders in the effort by some American bishops to deny the president communion had intensified a pressure campaign urging the pontiff to take their side. “Dear Pope Francis, You have boldly stated that abortion is ‘murder.’ Please challenge President Biden on this critical issue,” the arch-conservative Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., wrote on Twitter. “His persistent support of abortion is an embarrassment for the Church and a scandal to the world.” The pope may not be inclined to entertain suggestions from Bishop Tobin, who is often viewed within the Vatican as hostile to Francis’ agenda. Bishop Olson, a member of the U.S. bishops’ Committee on Doctrine, said the president’s comments added to the problem created by his public dissent from the Church on abortion, which the bishop said would cause moral confusion for other Catholics. “Now the president is no longer simply taking communion in this confused sense, he’s saying the pope is advocating for this confusion,” he said. “That in itself is a scandal.” Some prelates who hoped Francis might reprimand Mr. Biden have also spent years trying to undercut the pope’s authority. Cardinal Raymond Burke, whom many allies of Francis see as the de facto leader of the opposition to the pope in the Vatican and the United States, posted a nearly 3,000-word letter on his website before the meeting. In it, he said that American bishops would soon take up “the long-term and gravely scandalous situation of Catholic politicians who” support abortion rights and receive communion.

2021-10-29	16:52:06+00:00	Andrew Naughtie	The Independent	Study shows Texas abortion numbers halved in month after ban took effect	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/texas-abortion-access-ban-numbers-b1947939.html	Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile New research has found that over the course of September 2021, the number of abortions performed in Texas was half of that carried out the same month in 2020 – bringing the effect of the state’s new near-total ban on terminations into stark relief. According to the data gathered by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, the year-on-year number also surged by 28 per cent in August, likely reflecting the rush to secure reproductive care before the bill went into effect. In its research, the project, which is based at UT Austin, explains that before the ban, 93 per cent of abortions in the state were carried out at 19 facilities, which collectively saw the number of procedures they performed drop by 50 per cent – from 4,313 to 2,164. This, say the researchers, can be attributed to several factors, and not just the restrictions in the bill itself. The lead-up to the law’s introduction allowed clinics to prepare for it, while “patients also may have decided to miss work, school or give up other responsibilities out of concern they would no longer be eligible if they waited to schedule around these obligations.” People participate in the Houston Women's March against Texas abortion ban walk from Discovery Green to City Hall in Houston. On another front, the researchers say, “Increases in financial donations following passage of SB8 may have helped patients living on low incomes to cover the cost of their abortion (about $650), which they otherwise may have delayed until they could secure enough money.“ However, while the number of abortions performed in Texas has dropped dramatically, abortion facilities in neighbouring states are seeing waiting times rise, suggesting a surge in demand from people requiring reproductive health services now effectively outlawed in their home state. As the researchers note, seeking abortions elsewhere is not easy, especially since most of Texas’ neighbouring states are still highly conservative when it comes to abortion services. “Those who are able to travel out of state,” the report says, “face economic hardships related to covering the cost of travel, lodging, lost wages, and childcare, in addition to their abortion, which together could sum well over $1,000.” The Texas law sparked national and international outrage as it advanced through the legislature and to the governor’s desk this summer. Aside from the time limit it places on abortions – with a cutoff point at which many people do not even know they are pregnant – it empowers citizens to sue anyone whom they believe has sought an abortion or “aided and abetted” someone in obtaining one (or even just intended to). In their conclusion, the researchers lay out the implications of the legislation in stark detail. “As services become further limited in Texas and nearby states, more people will be unable to obtain facility-based abortion care. Among those most affected will be minors who cannot involve a parent in their care, immigrant families who fear encounters with police and border enforcement, parents who have limited childcare options, and people living at or below poverty, many of whom are Black, Latinx, and other people of colour. “Some may attempt to end their pregnancies on their own, by purchasing medications online, obtaining medications over the counter in Mexico, or resorting to ineffective or harmful measures. Others will be forced to continue their pregnancies, which is associated with adverse health and economic consequences for women and their children.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies A woman prepares to take abortion-inducing medication in Houston, Texas People participate in the Houston Women's March against Texas abortion ban walk from Discovery Green to City Hall in Houston.

The letter sent to every professional sports players’ association in the country, said recent legislation Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed, ranging from abortion to voting rights to banning COVID-19 mask mandates, has hurt women, children and people of color. “As we watch an incomprehensible assault on basic human rights unfold in Texas, we are simultaneously witnessing a threat to constitutional guarantees for women, children, and marginalized communities,” the letter signed by NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson and NAACP Texas State Conference President Gary Bledsoe stated. “Over the past few months, legislators in Texas have passed archaic policies, disguised as laws, that directly violate privacy rights and a woman’s freedom to choose, restrict access to free and fair elections for Black and brown voters, and increase the risk of contracting coronavirus.” “Texas lawmakers have destroyed the state’s moral compass by passing these laws,” they added. “In return, we are asking that you seek employment with sports teams located in states that will protect, honor and serve your families with integrity. … We are now pleading with you — if you are a free agent and are considering employment in Texas, look elsewhere.” Amid people of color disproportionately being infected, hospitalized or dying from the COVID-19 pandemic nationwide, they emphasized the Texas ban on school mask mandates and vulnerability of children who cannot yet receive the vaccine. “If you are Black, avoid Texas,” their letter stated. “If you want to lower your chances of dying from coronavirus, avoid Texas.” An NAACP statement on the letter also referred to Abbott signing into law in May an anti-abortion bill enforced by members of the public as a move that “empowered vigilantes with the authority of law to restrict women’s freedom to make choices about their bodies.” The Supreme Court declined to block the controversial law that bans abortions after six weeks into pregnancy last month in a 5-4 vote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her dissent the “Texas Legislature has deputized the State’s citizens as bounty hunters, offering them cash prizes for civilly prosecuting their neighbors’ medical procedures.” Also, last month, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offered to help employees in Texas relocate due to the new abortion law. Abbott told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” that more businesses were moving to the state due to its social policies. “People vote with their feet and this is not slowing down businesses coming to the state of Texas at all,” Abbott told CNBC, adding that people are leaving the liberal state of California in part because of its social policies. The NAACP also referred in the letter to Abbott signing a bill into law last month that adds new restrictions to early voting and new identification requirements, which critics say will disproportionately impact voters of color. Most recently, Abbott signed into law on Monday new congressional maps, which the NAACP’s letter Thursday said would “dilute the voices of people of color.” “People of color have driven 95% of the Texas population growth,” according to recently released data from the 2020 census, which the NAACP cited in the letter. “Yet, new voting legislation and political maps put these communities at risk of not being able to participate in their democracy,” the NAACP letter stated. “These laws are intended to suppress our constitutional right to vote.” The redistricting plans also prompted several Latino voters and voting civil rights groups to sue Texas, saying the new maps “unlawfully dilute the voting strength of Latinos.” Copyright 2021 United Press International, Inc.

But Pope Francis has resisted that approach to the Democratic president, with whom he holds many other policy concerns in common, including climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic. In its summary of the meeting, the Biden administration emphasised those issues. “Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution,” the White House said. “He lauded Pope Francis’ leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery.” In photos and videos of the meeting, the pair appeared to enjoy a warm, relaxed conversation. Pope Francis frequently laughed and smiled, in stark contrast to his dour composure at his meeting with the previous US president. According to the Vatican, the meeting lasted 75 minutes – significantly longer than the approximately 30 minutes the Pope spent with Donald Trump and 52 with Barack Obama. Mr Biden, who goes to weekly mass regularly and keeps a picture of the Pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. The Pope, meanwhile, has said that while the Church should oppose abortion, the issue should not become an all-consuming battle that distracts from matters such as immigration and poverty. “Communion is not a prize for the perfect,” the Pope has said. “Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church.” During their meeting, Mr Biden also gave the Pope a specially minted coin, which he said bore a symbol of his late son Beau’s military unit. The president said Beau would have wanted Pope Francis to have it. “I’m not sure this is appropriate, but there is a tradition in America that the president, that he gives to warriors and leaders,” Mr Biden said. “You are the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met, and I’d like to be able to give you a coin.” He also added, jokingly, that if Pope Francis did not have the coin on him next time they met, “you have to buy the drinks.” “I’m the only Irishman you’ve ever met who’s never had a drink,” Mr Biden added. “The Irish brought whiskey,” the Pope replied, laughing.

Following the hour-and-a-half meeting as part of his trip for the G20 summit, Biden told the press that the Pope blessed his rosary and celebrated his Catholicism. He added that they discussed fighting climate change as part of the Build Back Better agenda. “We just talked about the fact that he was happy I’m a good Catholic,” Biden said. “And I should keep receiving communion.” A second meeting with Biden, cardinals and White House aides followed shortly after the one-on-one meeting. Biden gave Pope Francis a “challenge coin.” “I’m not sure this is appropriate, but there is a tradition in America that the president, that he gives to warriors and leaders,” Biden said, per Fox News. “You are the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met, and I’d like to be able to give you a coin.” “I know my son would want me to give this to you,” he added, referring to his son Beau who passed away in 2015. “Tradition, is and I’m kidding, next time I see you, if you don’t have it, you have to buy the drinks,” Biden joked. “I’m the only Irish man you’ve ever met who has never had a drink.” 
2021-10-29	15:56:35+00:00	Unknown	Businessday | News You Can Trust	The task before Ayu as consensus PDP chairman	https://businessday.ng/politics/article/the-task-before-ayu-as-consensus-pdp-chairman/	The coast appears clear for Iyorchia Ayu, a former Senate president in the aborted third republic to emerge as the national chairman of Nigeria’s main opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) at the party’s national convention in Abuja on October 31. Ayu had emerged as consensus chairmanship candidate of the PDP after the position was zoned to the North. He had also emerged as the consensus national chairmanship candidate for the North-central zone after other contenders from the zone withdrew from the race. He was subsequently adopted as the candidate of the whole North after two other contenders from the North, former governor of Katsina State, Ibrahim Shema, and the incumbent deputy national chairman (North), Nazif Suleiman, stepped down for him. However, Ayu would be inheriting a party full of bickering, going through a difficult period, and would have his hand full in an attempt to restore the lost glory of the PDP. Thus, observers say that his immediate task would be to rebuild the party and reconcile aggrieved members across the country that apparently had become disconnected with the leadership style of former chairman, Uche Secondus. In the last few months, there had been obvious signs that the PDP was in trouble, while members and party chieftains had become increasingly dissatisfied with the leadership of Secondus and his failure to manage and resolve several crises in state chapters which had further polarised the party. Such was the case, that in the last one year, three state governors and several prominent chieftains have dumped the PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The governors are Dave Umahi of Ebonyi, Ben Ayade of Cross River, and Bello Matawale of Zamfara. Although the governors cited diverse reasons, analysts believe that instability in the PDP and the failure of Secondus to manage the issues in the party played a huge part. Political watchers say considering Ayu’s vast experience and pedigree in politics of unifying diverse forces in a political environment, he would have a huge task of mending fences already created by the intrigues of his emergence. “The emergence of Iyiocha Ayu through a consensus arrangement is supposed to be a unifying point for all warring groups and factions in PDP. So, it will be disastrous for him and his executive team not to work towards the unity of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections”, Kunle Okunade, a political analyst, said. Politics is about interest, hence in the South-West, there are high expectations among party members that Ayu’s tenure would benefit the region and lead to a more robust PDP. Consequently, expectations are high among party members in the South-West that after the new chairman assumes office; the party would find an answer to several contending issues in recent times which had affected the stability of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. Presently, several state chapters of the party in the region are polarised and engulfed in a leadership crisis. Examples could be seen in Lagos, Ogun chapters, where different factions are laying claims to the structure of the party. The leadership crisis in the Lagos chapter is particularly serious, and has been a reoccurring issue over the years and continues to adversely affect the fortunes of the PDP in the state. Even last Saturday’s state congress ended in chaos and was disrupted by touts. Also, among these issues expected to gain Ayu’s attention is the clamour that the party should zone the presidency to the South after the expiration of the tenure of incumbent Muhammadu Buhari who is from the North. Perhaps the zoning of the chairmanship position to the North has further fuelled that agitation. Even though there are several Nigerians who are of the view that the presidency should be chosen on competency and not on ethnicity or tribal lines in 2023. Observers say that the matter is a very sensitive one, which must be handled with care and for all intent and purposes it will serve. They say that the situation in the country needs someone with a magic wand and track record, to quickly return the country to the path of peace, unity, and economic prosperity. “If you watch, you’ll realise that both APC and PDP are watching each other’s moves to know how to place their own game. PDP has by consensus picked a former Senate president, Ayu from the North-Central as its national chairman, while other national working committee positions have been zoned strategically to various states for political balancing, with the national secretary to the South-East,” Adelaja Adeoye, PDP chieftain and member national convention organising publicity sub-committee said. Adeoye further stressed that the expectation of Southern members of the party is that the presidency would be zone to the South in view of Ayu’s emergence. According to him, “The expectation of Southern members of the party is that, as the national chairman is coming from the North, the presidential candidate should come from the South. “We must also take note of the sensitivity and sentiment of the Southern people in this regard, who want the position across parties rotated to the South, since Buhari who is from the North has done 8 years. Meanwhile, speaking further Okunade said that the emergence of Ayu’s as national chairman should give the South-West region hope in their quest for the presidential position to be zone to the region. “I think Ayu’s emergence is expected to give the Southern region hope in the political arrangement of the country and sense of belonging in the political sphere,” he said. Ayu is a former senator who was elected president of the Senate during the Nigerian third republic. (1992–1993). He later served in various ministerial positions in the cabinet of President Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 and 2007. Ayu was born in Gboko in Benue State. He taught sociology in the University of Jos, including courses on the art and science of Marxism. He was the chairman of the Jos University chapter of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). After entering politics, he was influential among the majority Tiv people in his home state of Benue. He was elected senator in the third republic on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and became Senate president. In November 1993, the senate impeached Ayu, who was a strong opponent of the Interim National Government established after the late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, the presumed elected ‘president’ had been prevented from taking office. Ayu, however, later became the minister for education in late General Sani Abacha’s military government. In March 1994 he chaired a workshop on technical education in Nigeria, seeking ways to learn from Germany, the United States, Britain and Japan.

Robinson fronts anti-abortion rally in downtown Raleigh	https://www.wral.com/lt-gov-robinson-fronts-anti-abortion-rally-in-downtown-raleigh/19950371/	" Posted October 28, 2021 9:11 p.m. EDTUpdated October 29, 2021 8:31 p.m. EDT By Keely Arthur, WRAL reporter, & Matthew Burns, WRAL.com senior producer/politics editor Raleigh, N.C. — Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson resumed his attack on LGBTQ issues in schools during a Friday morning rally in downtown Raleigh. The Republican, who's likely to run for governor in 2024, keynoted the Stand Up for America Rally that drew an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people to Halifax Mall. ""Lt. Gov. Robinson has distinguished himself as a spiritual John the Baptist, thundering out truth without apology and exposing the chaff of hypocrisy,"" Ron Baity, a Winston-Salem pastor and president of rally organizer Return America, said in introducing him. Robinson has been under fire for weeks after video surfaced of appearances he made at two churches this summer and at a North Carolina Values Coalition gala last month. ""If there's a movement in this country that is demonic and is full of anti-, the spirit of the antichrist, it is the transgender movement,"" Robinson said during an August appearance at Upper Room Church of God in Christ, in Raleigh. That followed comments he made at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove in June. ""There is no reason anybody, anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality or any of that filth,"" he said. ""And yes, I called it filth. And if you don't like it that I called it filth, come see me about it."" During the Values Coalition gathering, he urged parents to stand up to school boards and school administrators who are ""pushing these perverted agendas, to try to teach our children that they're really not boys or girls, or they're shoving this homosexuality garbage down their throats."" On Friday, Robinson continued to insist that he is calling for the removal of several LGBT-themed books from public school libraries and isn't bashing any individuals for their sexual orientation or gender identity. ""They want me to resign,"" he said of his critics. ""I'm going to resign myself to keep delivering the message of truth to the people of North Carolina. I'm going to resign myself to continue standing up for the constitutional rights of every citizen of this state, regardless of how they identify. Robinson blamed the news media for the controversy, saying outlets ""just want to make an example out of me."" To the cheers of the crowd, he went on to praise former President Donald Trump and criticize the policies of President Joe Biden's administration. ""Our government is out of control,"" he said. ""The angry and indignant patriots of this country and North Carolina are going to rein this country back into control. It's time for us to teach our nation a lesson."" He urged the crowd to stand up against ""enemies on the other side of the aisle that would drag this nation into a socialist hellhole."" ""The Christian patriots of this nation will own this nation and rule this nation and help freedom survive,"" he said. Return America states on its website that it wants ""to build a network of churches and individuals to educate, motivate and mobilize citizens in a united effort in promoting Judeo-Christian values."" ""I really believe there’s a majority of us, a silent majority, and here’s where we are speaking up,"" said Christy Maddox, of Asheboro, who was among the throngs at the rally. ""The church needs people that will listen to them,"" said Robert Hildebrand, of Stanley. LGBTQ advocates held a small rally of their own on Friday afternoon to counter Robinson's remarks. ""I don’t care if its five of us or 500 of us, we will be here every Friday standing against hate,"" said Rev. Vance Haywood, pastor of St. John's Metropolitan Community Church, in Raleigh. ""The simple, moral fact is that words kill. Mr. Robinson, in your statement and the words you continue to spew, you put countless lives at risk. You put countless lives in jeopardy."" Haywood and other LGBTQ advocates have pressed for Robinson to meet with them, but he hasn't responded. ""What bothers me is that Mr. Robinson’s words apparently are seen as a magnet for others, and we stand here to say that they simply are abhorrent to us, and we trust they are abhorrent to the majority of the public,"" said Rev. Doug Long, senior minister at Umstead Park United Church of Christ, in Raleigh. ""The bottom line is that Mr. Robinson does not see the LGBTQ community as human beings. He does not see them as equal human beings."""
2021-10-29	15:41:43+00:00	Associated Press	suntimes	Biden: Pope said he should ‘keep receiving communion’	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/10/29/22752684/biden-pope-keep-receiving-communion	"President Joe Biden’s support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. ROME — President Joe Biden said Pope Francis told him he should continue to receive Communion, as the world’s two most prominent Roman Catholics ran overtime in highly personal discussions on climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic that also touched on the loss of president’s adult son and jokes about aging well. Biden’s support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. Biden said abortion did not come up in the meeting at the Vatican. “We just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,” Biden said. Video released by the Vatican showed several warm, relaxed moments between Francis and Biden as they repeatedly shook hands and smiled. Francis often sports a dour look, especially in official photos, but he seemed in good spirits Friday. The private meeting lasted about 75 minutes, according to the Vatican, more than double the normal length of an audience with the pontiff The pair sat across from one another at a desk in the papal library, accompanied by a translator. They then proceeded to an exchange of gifts and a broader meeting including the first lady and top officials. The lengthy session put Biden more than an hour behind schedule. “Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution,” the White House said. “He lauded Pope Francis’ leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery.” Biden takes pride in his Catholic faith, using it as moral guidepost to shape many of his social and economic policies. He wears a rosary and attends Mass weekly. After leaving the Vatican, Biden said he had a “wonderful” and that the pope prayed for him and blessed his rosary beads. Asked what the prayer was about, Biden replied, “Peace.” A dozen Swiss Guards in their blue and gold striped uniforms and red-plumed halberds stood at attention in the San Damaso courtyard as Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived. They were received by Monsignor Leonardo Sapienza, who runs the papal household, and then greeted one by one the papal ushers, or papal gentlemen, who lined up in the courtyard. “It’s good to be back,” Biden said as he shook the hand of one of them. “I’m Jill’s husband,” he told another before he was ushered into the frescoed Apostolic Palace and taken upstairs to the pope’s private library. According to the Vatican, Biden presented Francis a woven chasuble, or liturgical vestment, made in 1930 by the famed papal tailor Gammarelli and used by the pope’s Jesuit order in the U.S., where it was held in the archives of Holy Trinity Church, Biden’s regular parish in Washington. The White House said it would make a donation to charity in the pope’s name. Holy Trinity is steeped in American history and played a role in advocating for abolition, desegregation and civil rights since it was founded in 1787. President John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic U.S. president, also worshipped there. Biden also slipped what’s known as a challenge coin into the pope’s palm during a handshake, and hailed Francis as “the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met.” The personalized coin depicts Biden’s home state of Delaware and a reference to his late son Beau’s military unit, the 261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade. Biden told Francis that Beau would have wanted him to present the coin to the pope. “The tradition is, and I’m only kidding about this, but next time I see you, if you don’t have it, you have to buy the drinks,” Biden said, referring to the coin. He added: “I’m the only Irishman you’ve ever met who’s never had a drink.” Francis laughed and responded: “The Irish brought whisky.” Biden, 78, also relayed the story of American baseball player Satchel Paige, a Black pitcher who played late into his fifties, in a parable about aging. “‘How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you were,’” Biden quoted Paige as saying. “You’re 65, I’m 60,” Biden added, as Francis, 84, pointed to his head and laughed. Francis presented Biden with a ceramic tile depicting the iconography of the pilgrim, as well as a collection of the pope’s main teaching documents, the Vatican said. In the Vatican video, he could be heard asking Jill Biden to “pray for me.” The warm encounter stood in stark contrast to Donald Trump’s 2017 meeting with Francis, with whom the former president had a prickly relationship. Photos from that 30-minute meeting showed a stone-faced Francis standing beside a grinning Trump. Biden’s meeting also was longer than the 52 minutes Barack Obama spent with Francis in 2014. Biden is visiting Rome and then Glasgow, Scotland, for back-to-back summits, first a gathering for leaders of Group of 20 leading and developing nations and then a global climate conference. Biden and Francis have previously met three times but Friday’s encounter was their first since Biden became president. Biden also met separately Friday with Group of 20 summit hosts Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He will end the day by meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, part of an effort to mend relations with France after the U.S. and U.K. decided to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, scotching an existing French contract. Biden’s meeting with Pope Francis generated some controversy in advance as the Vatican on Thursday abruptly canceled plans to broadcast the meeting with Biden live and denied press access. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the revised television plan reflected the virus protocol for all heads of state audiences, though he didn’t say why more robust live TV coverage had been initially scheduled and then canceled. The Vatican instead provide edited footage of the encounter to accredited media. The visit came as U.S. bishops prepared to meet in roughly three weeks in Baltimore for their annual fall convention. Among the agenda items is an effort by conservatives to disqualify Biden from receiving Communion. Any document emerging from the event is unlikely to single out the president by name, but he still could face some form of rebuke. Francis has stressed that he will not reject political leaders who support abortion rights, though Catholic policy allows individual bishops to choose whether to prevent people from taking Communion.

If you are a woman, avoid Texas. If you are Black, avoid Texas. If you want to lower your chances of dying from coronavirus, avoid Texas.” In the letter, the NAACP mentioned the WNBA, NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB. Texas is home to nine teams in those five leagues: the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers in MLB, the Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs in the NBA, the Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys in the NFL, the Dallas Stars in the NHL and the Dallas Wings in the WNBA. Texas is also home to Austin FC, FC Dallas and Houston Dynamo FC in MLS. “Texas is setting a precedent for effectively dismantling civil rights throughout the nation. Their top priority is infringing on their constitutional duty to promote the general welfare. It is time we take this situation into our own hands and stand up for what is right. It is up to those with a voice to stand up for the women in our lives, to protect our children and our fellow citizens. If you are considering signing in Texas, I ask you to ensure that owners are upholding their responsibility of protecting you, the athlete, and your family. I ask you to use your influence to help protect the constitutional rights of each individual at risk,” said NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson. “We are now pleading with you — if you are a free agent and are considering employment inTexas, look elsewhere. The Texas government will not protect your family. Demand that Texas owners invest in your rights and protect your investments. Texas is not safe for you, your spouse, or your children. Until the legislation is overturned, Texas isn’t safe for anyone.” Texas also isn’t a state that has an income tax, so it’ll probably continue to be just fine in terms of luring free agents.

2021-10-29	15:15:35+00:00	Maya Oppenheim	The Independent - Life and Style	‘Saving millions of lives’: Abortion could be decriminalised in Colombia in next month	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/abortion-colombia-constitutional-court-decriminalised-b1947814.html	‘Many women in Colombia are forced to have their rapist’s baby,’ says lawyer Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Abortion could be decriminalised in Colombia in the next month as landmark decisions to legalise pregnancy terminations in Latin America have a “ripple effect” across the region, campaigners said. Colombia decriminalised pregnancy terminations for women whose life or health is at risk, or in cases where there are fatal foetal abnormalities, or if the pregnancy is the by-product of rape or incest, back in 2006. But campaigners told The Independent women are still routinely blocked from having an abortion in these circumstances. Catalina Calderon, director of advocacy at the Women’s Equality Centre, told The Independent there are currently two planned discussions for the Colombian Constitutional Court which call for abortion to stop being deemed a criminal act. “As it is discriminatory against the girls and women in Colombia,” she added. “The first process has a deadline for the decision on 19 November, and the second on 20 January 2022. That said, if the constitutional court makes a decision to decriminalise abortion on these dates, we may have abortion legalised within the next two weeks.” Nevertheless, the current situation sees women in Colombia imprisoned simply for having an abortion while those who have fallen pregnant after being raped are forced to continue with their pregnancy. A study by Mesa Para la Vida y Salud de las Mujeres, an NGO, found at least 400 women and girls in Colombia are criminalised for getting abortions each year. Meanwhile, the Guttmacher Institute, a leading abortion rights organisation, discovered less than one per cent of the estimated 400,000 abortions carried out each year in Colombia are performed legally. Ms Calderon said: “In all other cases, women are still being forced into clandestinity. In Colombia, while there are abortion exceptions, the reality is these exceptions aren’t guaranteeing access to women even when they qualify for a legal abortion.” Ms Calderon added that her organisation’s on-the-ground work sees how the current rules “cause confusion, bureaucracy, and stigma”, which serve as “barriers for women who are forced to ‘prove’ over and over that they fit within the legal framework, often even needing to resort to legal injunctions and lawsuits to demand their right”. She explained the obstacles to obtaining an abortion result in rich women being able to have abortions, while impoverished or vulnerable women are blocked. “And end up facing the choice of continuing an unwanted pregnancy or resorting to unsafe, clandestine procedures,” Ms Calderon added. She warned backstreet abortions ultimately place “their health and lives at great risk” – claiming that “fully legalising abortion means saving millions of lives by prioritising the health and lives of women in Colombia”. It is difficult to get figures on the proportion of women who die in Colombia each year from clandestine abortions given the procedures are happening in secretive circumstances. However, the Ministry of Health estimates around 132,000 women go on to experience complications from unsafe abortion in Colombia each year, while roughly 70 women die every year. Ms Calderon attributed moves to make abortion legal in Colombia to the recent milestone abortion decisions in Argentina and Mexico in the last year – saying the region has witnessed a “monumental shift”. “The landmark decisions in Argentina and Mexico to decriminalise abortion have had a ripple effect throughout the region,” Ms Calderon added. “There is no bigger proof of this influence than the green handkerchief, the symbol of Argentina’s pro-abortion movement, that has become the region’s symbol, appearing as the landmark symbol of every feminist demonstration in cities across the subcontinent.” Argentina became the first major Latin American country to legalise abortion at the end of December, while Mexico’s Supreme Court last month ruled that criminal penalties for having a pregnancy terminated are unconstitutional. Colombia “may soon follow” as one of the biggest and “most influential” countries in the region to overhaul abortion laws, Ms Calderon added. She hailed the work of Causa Justa, which translates as “Just Cause”, a collective of organisations and healthcare providers, which campaigns for abortion to be decriminalised in Colombia. The study by La Mesa por la Vida y la Salud de las Mujeres found more than 70 per cent of women prosecuted for abortion were reported by a health professional. Meanwhile, 97 per cent of women prosecuted for getting an abortion were from the rural areas, and 30 per cent were victims of violence, including sexual violence. Ximena Casas, of Human Rights Watch, told The Independent the constitutional court has a “historic unique opportunity” as they did back in 2006 when exceptions for abortion were introduced. The court has the chance to ensure abortion is treated as a health issue rather than a criminal issue, the Colombian human rights lawyer said. Ms Casas, who lives in the Spanish capital of Madrid, noted between 1 per cent and 9 per cent of abortions are conducted in the public health sector in Colombia. She said: “The rest is private. Doctors can go to prison for providing an abortion. Women should not go to prison for exercising their reproductive rights. “Many women in Colombia are forced to have their rapist’s baby. There is a lot of stigma around abortion. We are a religious country where talking about sex and reproduction is very limited.” Ms Casas attributed anti-abortion laws and attitudes to the stigma that surrounds motherhood in Colombia – adding women should not be punished for not wanting children or feeling unable to continue with a pregnancy at that moment in their lives.

Biden has come under pressure from conservatives at home and his most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy have said he should be banned from receiving communion, the central sacrament of the faith. Asked if the topic of abortion came up during a long meeting with pope in the Vatican earlier on Friday, Biden said no. He said the pope told him he was happy he was a good Catholic and he should “keep receiving communion.” The president, who goes to weekly Mass regularly and keeps a picture of the pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. Last month, asked about the U.S. communion debate, the pope told reporters that abortion is “murder.” But he also appeared to criticize U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way.

2021-10-29	12:02:37+00:00	Unknown	upiasia	Texas abortion law further complicates difficult pregnancies	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/10/29/Texas-abortion-law-difficult-pregnancies/4231635507486/	"Oct. 29 (UPI) -- At her sonogram appointment in late September, Kendra Joseph received ominous news. Signs pointed to an impending miscarriage, but she wasn't far enough along for the doctor to know for sure. He told her to come back in a week. The 39-year-old San Antonio mom of one began to worry. Under Senate Bill 8, Texas' new abortion law, even if the medical and developmental condition were still grim, if they could hear cardiac activity, she would have to wait out the pregnancy or leave the state to end it. For nearly three years, Joseph and her husband, Eric, had been trying to have a second child, and laws intended to limit abortion access had, ironically, made the process more difficult. With SB 8 in effect, given the risks her pregnancies entail, Joseph is hesitant to keep trying at all -- one of the many unforeseen consequences of the new law. The reality of her pregnancies so far has not been as black-and-white as the language in the bill, crafted by a childless, single man: state Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola. On March 15, when Hughes discussed his bill to bar abortion after a patient is about six weeks into a pregnancy, he focused solely on what he called the heartbeat. ""That heartbeat is a key medical indicator of whether that unborn child is going to reach live birth,"" Hughes said during a meeting of the Senate State Affairs Committee, of which he is chair. Medical and legal experts say it is misleading to use ""heartbeat"" to refer to the cardiac activity of embryos at a developmental stage when they don't possess a heart. But for hundreds of thousands of pregnant Texans, especially those who face tough or unusual pregnancies, that cardiac activity is the starting point. Chromosomal conditions, malformed vital organs and other severe fetal abnormalities can develop along the way. When a doctor tells an expectant parent their child's condition is ""incompatible with life"" or ""lethal,"" they find themselves in a world of gray. When Joseph's first child was born five years ago -- a daughter conceived and delivered with the kind of predictability Joseph took for granted - she left her job as a middle school theater and debate teacher and started working as a real estate agent. She hoped to spend more time with her daughter, Adalynn, and the sibling or siblings she assumed would follow. Having been advised it might take longer to get pregnant as she was reaching what doctors consider ""advanced maternal age,"" the couple soon began to try for a second child. The average age for giving birth has increased in Texas, from 26.1 years old in 2009 to 28.3 years old in 2018, and is higher in the metro areas. In 2018, Joseph had her first miscarriage. It stunned her, in a way, how unprepared she was. ""We don't talk about pregnancy loss [in our culture],"" she said. When she got pregnant again in March 2019, Joseph was 36, officially a high-risk pregnancy. A pregnancy is considered to be at increased risk if the pregnant person is over 35. Certain conditions, like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, are more likely during pregnancy in older women, as is miscarriage. Doctors often recommend additional screening and monitoring. Genetic disorders are also more likely. And Joseph's Ashkenazi Jewish heritage also elevated the risk of certain genetic conditions like Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease, so she already planned on prenatal screening. Most genetic screening takes place at the end of the first trimester, well after cardiac activity is detected. Although it is optional, genetic screening, like ultrasounds and sonograms, is a common part of prenatal care. Genetic screening tools offer valuable information, said Lorie Harper, division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. But under SB 8, what families can do with that information is limited. Before the new law, some families went into genetic screening knowing if certain conditions were detected, they would terminate. ""We're not going to detect them before six weeks, because there's not a lot to detect on ultrasound,"" Harper said. Plenty of families who would not consider abortion want genetic screening anyway, so they can be prepared for challenges, and Harper is not sure if more families will decline genetic screening now that termination isn't an option. When Joseph arrived at her genetic screening appointment in 2019, she wasn't expecting to hear anything that would lead her to terminate the pregnancy. But when the results came in around her 15th week of pregnancy, her doctor delivered devastating news: The baby had trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, which is, in most cases, fatal before the baby's first birthday. ""We looked it up and we realized how terrible it really was,"" Joseph said. It's difficult to find consistent information on the chance of a baby with the condition being born alive because so many women decide to terminate their pregnancies once they are told their baby has trisomy 18. Of those babies born with the chromosomal abnormality, the median lifespan is 10-14 days, and only 12% percent survive until age 5. Many of the symptoms of the condition are painful. Advocates argue that more could be done to improve the odds of survival in babies with severe genetic disorders like trisomy 18, and claim that labeling the condition ""incompatible with life"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. But for the time being, the condition is considered imminently fatal. One of the reasons SB 8 used the objective presence of cardiac activity was to avoid the issue of ""viability,"" said Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago. ""Viability has actually been an ambiguous concept that policymakers around the country are getting away from,"" Seago said. ""That is a judgment call from the physician."" While doctors might feel they are the right ones to make that judgment call, he said, ""you can't punt to medical judgment when at the core it is an ethical issue."" Not every case of trisomy 18 is equally severe, but at 15 weeks, some of the more severe and painful effects of the condition were showing in Joseph's baby -- swelling was visible on the sonogram. It was a boy, which made his chances of survival even slimmer. Joseph and her husband couldn't take a wait-and-see approach. In 2019, Texas prohibited abortion after 20 weeks, and the law was unclear whether trisomy 18 would count as an exception due to ""severe fetal abnormality"" under the state's 2013 restrictions. They were watching the clock in another way as well: Joseph said they wanted to make the decision before her baby could feel pain -- whether from the abortion or from his medical condition. Doctors disagree on when the ability to experience pain develops, but Joseph's doctor assured her that at 15 weeks, it had not. When she decided to end the pregnancy, Joseph's doctors referred her to an abortion clinic. Insurance wouldn't cover the procedure and doing it in the hospital was, for the Josephs, like most people, prohibitively expensive. ""That was my first time entering an abortion clinic,"" she said. Joseph had always believed that carrying a pregnancy to term should be a woman's choice, as was abortion, but she didn't necessarily feel like she was exercising her rights. She felt like she was in a medical emergency, trying to make the right decision for her entire family. ""It was extremely emotional. We wanted this baby so bad. We really did. My ultimate decision was because I didn't want him suffering,"" Joseph said. They decided to name the baby and called him Arlo. Because of Texas' 2003 ""Women's Right To Know Act,"" a law authored by then-state Rep. Frank Corte Jr., R-San Antonio, Joseph had to visit the clinic twice. On the first day, she sat with a room full of other women, listening to information about the procedure. Under Corte's legislation, any pregnant person in Texas must wait 24 hours before going back to the clinic to have an abortion. So the next day, Joseph went back and, after sitting for hours in a packed waiting room, had the abortion. Texas had just 22 abortion clinics at that point in 2019, and those facilities provided about half of the more than 56,000 medically induced abortions performed on Texas residents that year. The other half were performed at ambulatory surgery centers, and about 1% were in hospitals or outside the state. In the nearly two months since SB 8 went into effect, news reports show this demand is shifting entirely to out-of-state providers who are struggling to meet it. Although she was heartbroken over losing the baby, Joseph was also keenly aware of how much she benefited from resources like therapy, insurance and a partner able to drive her to appointments -- things not everyone has. She was thankful that Eric could handle the flood of paperwork and even more thankful they were both employed and could afford the $1,000 procedure. Over the next two years, she would lose some of those resources herself, and her dreams for a second child would seem more and more unlikely. Time was not on Joseph's side. Her hormone levels indicate her egg reserves, which decrease over time, are already lower than average. Last year, the couple met with a doctor to begin in vitro fertilization. The first round didn't produce enough eggs, so they started again in May, as the Legislature was passing SB 8. Joseph was watching the bill closely, wondering what it would mean for their work with the fertility specialist. For families looking to increase their chances of getting pregnant quickly with IVF, some opt to try with two or more embryos transferred into the uterus at once. Whether to recommend multiple-embryo transfer is a complex issue in the IVF community. If more than one embryo implants -- resulting in a multiple pregnancy -- the associated risk increases. Now, doctors advising these families have to work within the limits of SB 8, said Elizabeth Sepper, who teaches health law at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. ""Often the implantation of multiple embryos means selective reduction toward the end of the first trimester to help increase the odds of a successful pregnancy,"" said Sepper. ""These procedures can't be done consistent with SB 8."" The effects of an anti-abortion bill on fertility treatments is always an area of concern, said Seago, but seeking an abortion after a fertility treatment is the same as any other abortion: the taking of a human life. As the Josephs watched SB 8 signed into law on May 19, they were scheduled for egg retrieval the next week. Then Eric lost his job at Caterpillar and, with that, their insurance. They discontinued IVF, and Joseph started having more serious doubts. When she thinks about the new barriers created by SB 8 -- what it would have been like waiting for Arlo to die -- she wonders if it's worth the risk to try again. ""It just makes what was already a hard situation impossible,"" Joseph said. She's not alone in her hesitation. Austin OB-GYN Rachel Breedlove said she's seeing patients consider or ask for more reliable forms of birth control -- like IUDs -- now that abortion is not an option. ""It's on people's minds,"" Breedlove said. Exceptions in the law provide little reassurance, she said. What patients and their doctors consider an ""emergency"" situation might still open them up to litigation under SB 8. The law uses ""emergency"" with little clarification, similar to the exception for ""severe fetal abnormalities"" in the 2013 law -- those terms are not absolute in the medical field. ""The language doesn't protect doctors,"" Breedlove said. ""It protects the people suing them."" Fear of being sued for ""aiding and abetting"" an abortion could lead to more hesitancy around offering what is ultimately appropriate medical care, said Harper, who is also an associate professor in the women's health department at Dell Medical School. ""Termination is sometimes appropriate medical care for women."" Some people know that they cannot safely take a pregnancy to term because of pre-existing medical conditions, but they may also not have reliable birth control or their birth control can fail. All they can do now, if they cannot leave Texas, is let the situation play out until it becomes an unquestionable emergency -- by which time the risk to their health is even greater. Even if a situation would ultimately qualify as an emergency, or the procedure would be legal, such as in an ectopic pregnancy, Harper worries that doctors will be too fearful to recommend it when they otherwise would, or the need to involve lawyers will result in delayed care. Then when all agree the procedure is both legal and necessary, finding someone to perform it will be a whole different barrier, Harper said. As hospitals consider their liability, Harper worries fewer will offer termination-focused medical procedures and surgeries, and with ambulatory clinics closing, women won't have access to what few abortions are still legal. Those who can will go across state lines, but not everyone can. When Joseph found out she was pregnant a fourth time in September, her excitement was mixed with apprehension, and it only got worse when the first ultrasound showed signs of trouble. A week later, when she went back to her doctor, the situation was clear: There was no cardiac activity. She was able to take misoprostol, a drug that speeds up the miscarriage process, which can take weeks. As she continues to see her therapist and sort out the disappointment and grief of the past four years, Joseph has shared her story with family and friends, including those who are ardently against abortion. The feedback has been encouraging, she said. People, she said, have been willing to see the ""gray areas"" of abortion -- situations already fraught with trauma and sadness -- overlooked in the language of laws. ""It's given me a very different view,"" Joseph said. ""I see pregnancy, I see loss, I see the decision to not follow through. ... It's very private. I don't think anyone comes through it lightly.""

Aminu Suleman, the public relations officer of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS), Edo State Command, who confirmed the incident in a statement made available to journalists in Benin City, said there was no escape of any inmates or death. Suleman said the attempted jailbreak, which started at 12:30 pm, was initiated by a confrontation between some awaiting-trial inmates, especially the recaptured escapees, and convicted inmates. He further said reinforcement was immediately mobilised from the state headquarters to enforce law and order.

The command’s image maker said the situation has been brought under control, adding that investigation into the incident has been instituted by the controller to unravel the immediate and remote causes of the disturbance. “The controller of corrections, Felix Lawrence, wishes to assure the general public that they should go about their normal business without any fear,” he added. Recall that many inmates escaped from the correctional center during the #EndSARS protest in October last year.
2021-10-29	10:14:34+00:00	Unknown	nationalpost	Biden meets pope as abortion debate flares back home	https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/biden-meets-pope-as-abortion-debate-flares-back-home-2	VATICAN CITY — Joe Biden arrived at the Vatican on Friday for a meeting with Pope Francis expected to center on climate change and injustice but which has been overshadowed by debate at home about the Catholic U.S. president’s support for abortion rights. The president’s motorcade approached under tight security, made even more intense because the Italian capital is simultaneously preparing to host the G20 summit of world leaders this weekend. Swiss Guards in their traditional red, yellow and blue uniforms and holding halberds gave Biden and his wife, Jill, an honor salute as they and the U.S. delegation arrived in the San Damaso courtyard of the Apostolic Palace. The U.S. flag flew from the central balcony. The head of the Pontifical Household, Monsignor Leonardo Sapienza, led them to the third floor of the palace, where formally attired ushers known as the “pope’s gentlemen” waited to escort them down frescoed halls to the official papal library. “Thank you so much. It’s good to be back,” Biden told one of the officials on the receiving line in the courtyard. He then joked with another official who was talking to his wife. “I’m Jill’s husband,” Biden said. The meeting between the first Latin American pope and the second Catholic president in U.S. history takes place amid fierce debate in the United States Church, where Biden in under pressure from conservatives over his conflicted position in the dispute over abortion rights. The president, who goes to weekly Mass regularly and keeps a picture of the pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. His most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy have said Biden, a Democrat, should be banned from receiving communion, the central sacrament of the faith, and doubled down ahead of the meeting. “Dear Pope Francis, you have boldly stated that abortion is ‘murder.’ Please challenge President Biden on this critical issue. His persistent support of abortion is an embarrassment for the Church and a scandal to the world,” Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, said in a Tweet. On his website, another American conservative, Cardinal Raymond Burke, without naming Biden, spoke of the “grave scandal caused by such Catholic politicians.” “They have, in fact, contributed in a significant way to the consolidation of a culture of death in the United States, in which procured abortion is simply a fact of daily life,” Burke said. In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. The bishops, who went ahead despite a Vatican warning that it would sow discord rather than unity, will take up the issue again next month. Asked about the U.S. communion debate last month, the pope told reporters that abortion is “murder.” But he also appeared to criticize U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way. “Communion is not a prize for the perfect. … Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,” the pope said, adding that bishops should use “compassion and tenderness” with Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. Since his election in 2013 as the first Latin American pope, Francis has said that while the Church should oppose abortion, the issue should not become an all-consuming battle in culture wars that detracts attention from matters such as immigration and poverty.

2021-10-29	05:42:14+00:00	Press Association	thejournal	Covid-19 and climate change on the agenda as Pope and Joe Biden meet	https://www.thejournal.ie/pope-biden-meeting-covid-climate-5586778-Oct2021/	"Updated Oct 29th 2021, 8:26 PM US PRESIDENT JOE Biden and Pope Francis engaged in extended talks on climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic today. The world’s two most prominent Roman Catholics ran overtime in highly personal discussions that also touched on the loss of president’s adult son and jokes about ageing well. Video released by the Vatican showed several warm, relaxed moments between Francis and Biden as they repeatedly shook hands and smiled. Francis often sports a dour look, especially in official photos, but he seemed in good spirits. Their private meeting lasted about 75 minutes, according to the Vatican, an unusually long time for an audience with the pontiff. The pair sat across from one another at a desk in the papal library, accompanied by a translator. They then proceeded to an exchange of gifts and a broader meeting including the first lady and top officials. The lengthy session put Biden more than an hour behind schedule for his later meetings. “Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution,” the White House said. “He lauded Pope Francis’ leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery.” A dozen Swiss Guards in their blue and gold striped uniforms and red-plumed halberds stood at attention in the San Damaso courtyard as Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived. They were received by Monsignor Leonardo Sapienza, who runs the papal household, and then greeted one by one the papal ushers, or papal gentlemen, who lined up in the courtyard. “It’s good to be back,” Biden said as he shook the hand of one of them. “I’m Jill’s husband,” he said to another, before being escorted into the frescoed Apostolic Palace and taken upstairs to the pope’s private library. Jill Biden arrives in the courtyard of San Damaso inside the Apostolic Building. Source: Alamy Stock Photo White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in previewing the visit, said she expects a “warm and constructive dialogue” between the two leaders. “There’s a great deal of agreement and overlap with the president and Pope Francis on a range of issues: poverty, combating the climate crisis, ending the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. “These are all hugely important, impactful issues that will be the centrepiece of what their discussion is when they meet.” National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president and pontiff would meet privately, then hold talks with expanded delegations. Biden is visiting Rome and then Glasgow, Scotland, for back-to-back summits, first a gathering for leaders of Group of 20 leading and developing nations and then a global climate conference.

2021-10-29	05:06:11+00:00	ABC News	ABC News	Joe Biden, 2nd Catholic president, to meet Pope Francis amid US bishops' criticism	https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-2nd-catholic-president-meet-pope-francis/story?id=80769817	"Conservative U.S. bishops oppose Biden's public position on abortion. As President Joe Biden embarked on only his second overseas trip, he started with a personally poignant audience with Pope Francis on Friday, the first time in more than half a century that a Roman Catholic U.S. leader has met at the Vatican with the head of the Catholic Church. The White House said the private meeting lasted about 90 minutes, unusually long. Overshadowing the meeting was criticism from conservative U.S. bishops over Biden's public, political position on abortion, some arguing Biden and other politicians who share his views should be denied Communion. And at a later photo op with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, when a reporter asked, ""Did the issue of abortion come up at all?"" Biden responded, ""No, it didn’t. It came up -- we just talked about the fact that he was happy I was a good Catholic and keep receiving Communion."" Biden, only the second Catholic elected president after John Fitzgerald Kennedy, spoke of the moment's significance last month. ""I happen to be a practicing Catholic and one of the things I like about my pope today is he's all about renewal and forgiveness, that's what that's what he's about. And I look forward to -- I hope I get to see him in the not-too-distant future,"" he said in September. In a statement after Friday's meeting, the White House said ""President Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution. He lauded Pope Francis’ leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery."" At one point, the two men exchanged gifts. “I’m not sure this is appropriate, but, there is a tradition in America that the president has what is called a command coin that he gives to warriors and leaders, and you are the most significant warrior for peace I've ever met,” Biden can be heard explaining to Francis in edited footage released by the Vatican, as an interpreter shares the message with the pope. The Vatican did not allow U.S. news photographers inside. Biden described the symbols on the coin, and the personal connection it has to his late son, Beau, telling Francis he knew Beau would want him to have it. ""It has the U.S. seal in the front. ... I know my son would want me to give this to you because on the back of it, I have the state of Delaware in the 261st Unit my son served with,"" Biden said. Later, at a photo op with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, ABC's Ben Gittleson asked Biden how the meeting went. ""Wonderful,"" Biden replied. When asked what they discussed, he answered, ""A lot of personal things."" This is not the first time the two have met. In fact, the pair have spent more time together than perhaps any previous U.S. president and pope -- a distinction not lost on Shaun Casey, a senior fellow at Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University. ""They've known each other for the entire papacy. And this will not be their first meeting, which I think makes it fairly unique in American presidential history, it may be even in papal history that these two guys know each other to a degree that no other analogous pair do."" said Casey, who served as a special representative for religion, and global affairs to Secretary of State John Kerry during the Obama administration. ""These guys know each other, and I think they're comfortable with each other and they have a relationship that seems to be very warm and very genuine."" As vice president, Biden attended Francis’ inauguration in 2013, and helped shepherd him during his visit in Washington in 2015, before once again meeting Francis at the Vatican in 2016 for a conference on regenerative medicine. Francis’ visit to the United States was particularly touching for Biden, coming just a few months after the passing of his son, Beau, from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, that May. ""He asked to meet with the family in the hangar in the airport as he was leaving in Philly,"" Biden recalled of Francis in an interview with CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert last year. ""He came in. We had 16 family members there, and he didn't just speak about Beau, he spoke in detail about Beau, about who he was and about family values and about forgiveness and about decency. I mean, he is -- I am a great admirer of His Holiness, I really am,"" Biden continued. He keeps a photo of himself and Francis in the Oval Office. Yet, Biden's political views have sometimes put him at odds with the church on issues like gay marriage and abortion, issues that still divide him and Francis. Despite that, the two men share similar views when it comes to helping the poor, the need to address climate change and combatting the pandemic. According to Casey, Francis places the church's ""pastoral"" role above its ""theological"" one -- an outlook that bonds him with the American president. ""Biden draws meaning and sustenance and healing from how the church has been with him during his grief over his long public career. And so in essence, there's a pastoral bond there, in addition to the sort of social teachings bond that they share. Francis is not the only pope Biden has met in his nearly 50 years in Washington. Biden also met with Pope Benedict XVI in 2011, and in 1980, the then-senator met for 45 minutes with Pope John Paul II. ""He kept kidding me about how young I am,"" Biden told The Dialogue, the newspaper of the Wilmington, Delaware, diocese following the meeting. Biden also recalled ""discussions with the pope were relatively uninterrupted, even though several times during their conversation aides knocked on the library door, only to be waved away by John Paul."" Biden is perhaps the most publicly religiously observant president the country has seen since Jimmy Carter. He attends Mass almost every weekend and on holy days of obligation, very often accompanied by family members, and wears Beau's rosary beads on his wrist. ""My religion defines who I am,"" Biden said during the 2012 vice presidential debate. ""I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who — who can't take care of themselves, people who need help."" Biden attended Catholic school growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, and has cited his faith as helping him to weather some major traumas in his life, including the death of his young wife and daughter in a 1972 traffic accident, and his son in 2015. ""I never miss Mass,"" Biden said last August. ""It is part of who I am. It's what gets me through the very difficult times in my life, and I believe it very strongly."" But even as he acknowledges the profound impact his religious devotion has had on his life, Biden largely deems his faith to be a ""private matter"" and not open for public discussion. ""I don't proselytize. This is just a private thing with me and I feel very -- my faith ... means a great deal to me. And it's been sort of my salvation,"" Biden said in 2019. But Biden’s private faith has become the subject of a major public debate during his presidency. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has criticized him for his stance on abortion, and voted to draft guidance on who should be able to receive the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist -- the consecrated host Catholics believe is the Body of Christ. Biden, who campaigned on codifying Roe v. Wade, and announced his opposition to the Hyde Amendment, which prevents the use of public funds for abortions, during the 2020 campaign, has drawn a line between his public and private views of the issue. ""My position is that I am personally opposed to abortion, but I don’t think I have a right to impose my view on the rest of society,"" Biden wrote in his 2007 memoir. That position has caused problems for Biden in the past. In 2019, Biden was denied Communion at a South Carolina Catholic church while campaigning for president. ""Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching. As a priest, it is my responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to my care, and I must do so even in the most difficult situations. I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,"" Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Florence, South Carolina, said in a statement. For his part, Biden brushed off the incident as a one-off event, saying, ""it’s not a position I’ve found anywhere else, including from the Holy Father who gives me Communion."" A vote on the new guidance for Eucharistic eligibility, pushed by conservative bishops, is set to take place in mid-November, and would require support from two-thirds of the conference to be implemented, but the effort has not been received warmly by the Vatican. Francis has made clear that Holy Communion is ""not a prize for the perfect,"" and does not believe in denying Communion. ""What must the pastor do?"" Francis asked aboard the papal plane in September. ""Be a pastor, don’t go condemning. Be a pastor, because he is a pastor also for the excommunicated."" ""The bishops here in the U.S. cannot miss the symbolism of the warm embrace of Joe Biden by Pope Francis,"" Casey said of the visit. Even if approved, implementation would be up to local bishops. The Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, has also said he does not support denying Communion, as has Holy Trinity Catholic Church, which Biden attends in Washington. ""As a parish which has a long history of welcoming all, we concur with and support the pastoral approach of our Archbishop. Holy Trinity Catholic Church will not deny the Eucharist to persons presenting themselves to receive it,"" the parish said in a statement. When Biden was asked about the effort earlier this year, he simply replied, ""That's a private matter, and I don't think that's going to happen.""

Biden, a devout Catholic, attends weekly mass and Catholic holy days. He carries rosary beads that belonged to his deceased son Beau and he keeps a photo of himself and the Pope behind his desk in the Oval Office in the first row of pictures next to ones with his family. This will be the fourth time the two men meet and the meeting kicks of Biden's five-day trip to Europe. He'll also attend the G20 meeting in Rome over the weekend before heading to Scotland on Monday for the UN Climate Summit known was COP26. Biden's sitdown with Pope Francis comes as his administration is fighting Texas' abortion law, the most restrictive law in the nation, which bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected and that is normally after six weeks and before many women even know they are pregnant. Meanwhile, shortly after Biden's meeting with Pope Francis, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops will convene in Baltimore in mid-November where it will debate whether Catholic politicians who support abortion rights should be admonished for receiving Communion. White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wouldn't say whether or not Biden would receive communion during his Vatican visit. 'That's very personal,' she said. 'I don't have anything to share about that.' President Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, keeps a photo of himself and Pope Francis on his desk in the Oval Office, it can be seen above to the left of the president Then Vice President Joe Biden (left) and Pope Francis (right), with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell standing behind them, wave from a balcony at the U.S. Capitol after the Pope addressed a joint-session of Congress in September 2015 In June, the divided U.S. Conference of Bishiops voted to draft a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish these Catholic politicians, including Biden, the second Catholic president after John F. Kennedy. They did so despite warning from the Vatican such a move could sow seeds of discord. The bishops will discuss the issue further at their November gathering. 2016: Conference on regenerative medicine, where he spoke on cancer prevention. Hunter Biden and Ashley's husband came along Biden takes communion. He has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader. It's unclear if Biden and Pope Francis will discuss abortion at their private meeting on Friday, their first since Biden became president. Francis has strongly upheld the church's opposition to abortion, calling it 'murder.' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday that the two men will discuss climate change, migration and income inequality. And White House Jen Paski said the two men would focus on what areas they have in common. 'There is a great deal of agreement and overlap with the President and Pope Francis on a range of issues: poverty, combating the climate crisis, ending the COVID-19 pandemic. These are all hugely important, impactful issues that will be the centerpiece of what their discussion is when they meet,' she said. Biden will also meet with His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State, while at the Vatican. First lady Jill Biden will join the president for his audience with the pope. Meanwhile, the Vatican on Thursday abruptly canceled the planned live broadcast of Biden's meeting with the pope. The Vatican press office provided no explanation for why it was trimmed to cover just the arrival of the president's motorcade in the courtyard of the Apostolic Palace, where a Vatican monsignor will greet him. Cancelled was any live coverage of Biden actually greeting Francis in the palace Throne Room, as well as the live footage of the two men sitting down to begin their private talks in Francis' library. The Vatican said it would provide edited footage of the encounter. Pope Francis (left) greets then Vice President Joe Biden (right) at the Vatican in April 2016, before President Donald Trump was elected. Biden's son Hunter (second from right) and son-in-law Howard Krein (center) stand along his side Biden talked about his relationship with Pope Francis last October when he addressed the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, doing so from Wilmington's Queen theater because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Biden talked about his first meeting with Pope Francis during the Pope's 2013 inauguration at the Vatican when Biden was vice presdient. 'When I greeted him he said, ""Mr. Vice President you're always welcome here,""' Biden said. 'He was really sending a message to the world to put out a welcome sign in the front door of our church.' Biden also mentioned Pope Francis' trip to the White House in 2015 - when he was in office with President Barack Obama - saying that like his visit to the Vatican in 2013, it gave him the sense of 'hope and possibility together.' 'And for me it came at a very personal moment, a very tough time in the life of my family. Our son Beau had just died a few months earlier,' Biden said. 'Pope Francis took the time to meet with my entire family to help us see the light through the darkness.' Biden, as vice president, also traveled to the Vatican in April 2016 for a stem cell conference. At the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, Biden said that his friendship with Pope Francis was proof that 'anything is possible' in the U.S. 'I live in an amazing country, we all live in an amazing country,' Biden said. 'Where an Irish-Catholic kid like me from Scranton, Pennsylvania would one day befriend a Jesuit Pope.' 'But that's who we are as a country,' Biden said. -President John F. Kennedy´s 1963 meeting with Pope Paul VI at the Vatican was historic: The first Roman Catholic president of the United States was seeing the Roman Catholic pontiff only days after his coronation. Kennedy, who faced anti-Catholic bias during his presidential campaign, shook hands with the pope rather than kissing his ring, as is the usual practice for Catholics. -Pope Paul VI´s trip to New York in October 1965 presented protocol problems. President Lyndon Johnson wanted to see him, but the pontiff was a chief of a state not officially recognized by the U.S. The solution: Johnson flew to New York for dinner at the apartment of his friend Arthur Goldberg, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the pontiff was welcomed to Johnson´s suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel the next day. -Johnson had a penchant for somewhat odd papal presents. At that 1965 meeting, his gifts to Paul included a silver-framed, autographed photograph of himself. Two years later, at their next meeting at the Vatican, Johnson presented the pontiff with a foot-high bust of himself. -Jimmy Carter was the first president to play host to a pope at the White House. Pope John Paul II's stay at the White House featured 10,000 guests -- split between separate arrival and departure ceremonies on the North and South Lawns. -President Ronald Reagan had trouble keeping his eyes open on his first visit to the Vatican in 1982. Reagan´s head bobbed and his eyes repeatedly closed for seconds at a time while John Paul talked solemnly of crises in the Falkland Islands and Lebanon. The incident came during a 10-day European trip with a packed schedule for Reagan. But it fed already rampant talk that the 71-year-old president wasn´t physically up to the job. -Reagan sparked controversy over the separation of church and state in 1984 by establishing formal U.S. diplomatic relations with the Vatican, a long desire of the Holy See. Shortly afterward, Reagan and John Paul met during refueling stops at the airport in Fairbanks, Alaska (their paths were crossing as one finished and one began trips to Asia). The Alaska stop generated lots of excitement, but also scores of T-shirts reading 'The Pope Meets the Dope.' -For his last of four meetings with Pope John Paul, President Bill Clinton flew to St. Louis to greet the pontiff as he began a U.S. tour. Back in Washington, the Senate was in the throes of its impeachment trial against Clinton, and John Paul said 'America faces a time of trial.' But it was generally assumed that the pontiff, who also challenged Americans to 'a higher moral vision,' was speaking about his long-running and sharp dispute with Clinton over the president's support for abortion rights. -At George W. Bush´s last meeting with John Paul, at the Vatican in June 2004, he presented the pope with the Medal of Freedom, the nation´s highest civilian honor. The pontiff responded by reading a statement about his 'grave concern' over events in Iraq, where the U.S.-led war had been going on for just over a year. -After John Paul died in 2005, Bush became the first sitting U.S. president to attend a papal funeral. -At his first audience with John Paul´s successor, Pope Benedict XVI, Bush´s overly casual behavior was noted by many Italians and Vatican watchers. He addressed the pope as 'sir,' rather than the customary 'your holiness,' and leaned far back in his chair with one leg thrown informally over another, instead of the ramrod-straight physical posture more commonly seen in the pontiff´s presence. Rome´s ANSA agency flashed a 'Gaffe Presidente' headline. -For Benedict´s first U.S. tour as pope, there were several presidential firsts: Bush traveled to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to meet the pontiff´s plane, brought the largest crowd of his presidency to the South Lawn for Benedict´s arrival ceremony, and hosted a dinner in the pope´s honor that Benedict didn't attend. -Former President Barack Obama met with Pope Francis twice, once at the Vatican in 2014 and again during the pope´s 2015 visit to the U.S., where Obama met Francis on the tarmac at Andrews and played host in the Oval Office. Before 11,000 people on the South Lawn of the White House, Obama praised the pope as a 'living example of Jesus´ teachings,' while Francis lauded Obama for his commitment to addressing climate change. -Former President Donald Trump had a famously prickly relationship with Pope Francis. The two sparred during the 2016 campaign, with Francis taking a veiled swipe at Trump by declaring that people who think only of building barriers instead of bridges are 'not Christian.' Trump, who campaigned on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, called the comments 'disgraceful' and suggested the Mexican government was using Francis as a pawn. When the two met at the Vatican in 2017, photos showed a stone-faced Francis standing next to a grinning Trump. The president later said their meeting had been 'fantastic.'

2021-10-29	03:14:31+00:00	Unknown	thehoya	Students Protest for 24 Hours in Support of Abortion Rights	https://thehoya.com/students-protest-for-24-hours-in-support-of-abortion-rights/	October 28, 2021 by Nick Cohen Leave a Comment Student activists gathered outside the Supreme Court for 24 hours protesting the Texas Heartbeat Act. The 496 Abortion Rally, named for the average number of miles someone living in Texas must travel to get an abortion after the passage of the Texas Heartbeat Act last month, was organized by Georgetown University College Democrats (GUCD) and H*yas for Choice and began at midnight Oct. 23. Over 50 students and community members participated in shifts at the demonstration throughout the day. The rally helped to raise awareness about the Texas law on campus, according to GUCD vice chair and advocacy director Nico Reyes (COL ’24), who helped to organize the rally. “By being there for 24 hours, by bringing out so many people to go protest, by spreading our message all over social media, by getting people to talk about it, we made this an issue on campus,” Reyes said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We made people talk about it. We made people get educated on it. Those individual events cause ripples.” The Texas Senate Bill 8, which came into effect Sept. 1, prohibits abortion in most cases and as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law also prohibits abortions in cases of rape or incest and allows private individuals to sue abortion providors. The Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to block the law; instead, the court has opted to fast-track appeals from the Department of Justice and abortion rights providers in Texas. Reyes said in addition to rasing awareness on campus, the protest was also to protect abortion rights nationwide. “What was terrifying about this bill being passed is not only did it affect women in Texas, but it opened the door for every other U.S. state to follow,” Reyes said. “I was incredibly disappointed to see that the Supreme Court didn’t act.” Individuals outside of the Georgetown community attended the rally, including students from George Washington University, American University as well as Carleah Summers, a Democratic candidate running to represent Maryland’s 6th District, according to Reyes. Reyes said organizers chose the Supreme Court because of the institution’s history as a place for activists to gather and inspire change. “It was pretty incredible to be sitting in the same spot as people who have demanded change throughout history,” Reyes said. People who do not live in Texas have a duty to advocate for those whose abortions rights are under attack, according to GUCD treasurer Sarah Ackels (MSB ’24), who attened the rally. “As a woman in Washington D.C., I’m really grateful that I have access to abortion health care, but I definitely have a responsibility to advocate for those who don’t,” Ackels said in a phone interview with The Hoya. Since the law took effect, abortion rights activists across the country have pushed for abortion protection on the federal level, with the Women’s March holding an abortion rights rally last month at the steps of the Supreme Court. Ackels said people must pay attention to the Supreme Court and vote in midterm elections to protect abortion rights. “Advocacy in any form is never over. I think that being aware and staying on top of what the Supreme Court is doing about this is really imporant, and I also think that voting in midterm elections can have a high impact on the legislation that gets passed in the future with regard to abortion rights,” Ackels said. It is vital people advocate for abortion rights, according to Nico Hwang (COL ’23), who participated in the rally. “We do care about this, we do think that this is an important thing and we do think that this needs to change,” Hwang said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I personally think it’s the right thing to do, to advocate for this particular right.” Reyes said he believes protests have the power to influence future political decisions. “I know activism can change people, and I want to be a part of that change,” Reyes said.

Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, signed the letter outlining Texas's legislation on abortion, face masks and voting rights. Johnson believes these are reasons professional athletes should avoid doing Texas teams during free agency. ""When all else fails, we must look within and answer the call to protect the basic human rights and democratic values which are fundamental to this country"" Johnson said. ""Professional athletes serve as some of our country's greatest role models and we need them to join us to fight for democracy."" Of the five leagues (NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB and NHL) mentioned in the letter, only nine teams reside in Texas. Over the last five months, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a sweeping series of legislation that the letter calls ""archaic policies disguised as laws"", including a law banning abortions after six weeks and another banning vaccine requirements. The laws directly violate ""privacy rights and a woman's freedom to choose, restrict access to fee and fair elections for Black and brown voters as well as increase the risk of contracting coronavirus,"" the letter read. ""Texas is setting a precedent for effectively dismantling civil rights throughout the nation,"" the letter read. ""... If you are considering signing in Texas, I ask you to ensure that owners are upholding their responsibility of protecting you, the athlete, and your family. I ask you to use your influence to help protect the constitutional rights of each individual at risk."""

Roger Steinman/AP hide caption The NAACP urges professional athletes to reconsider signing with teams in Texas in light of the state's voting and abortion laws. The NAACP is urging athletes in major sports to consider not signing with professional teams in Texas in response to the state's voting and abortion laws and its ban on mask requirements. Leaders of the NAACP issued an open letter Thursday to players associations for the NBA, NFL, WNBA, MLB and NHL. The NAACP leaders called Texas' laws ""a blueprint by legislators to violate constitutional rights for all,"" and asked free agents to reconsider moving their families to a state that is ""not safe for anyone."" The civil rights organization reminded the free agents to also consider the influence their platforms hold. ""When all else fails, we must look within and answer the call to protect the basic human rights and democratic values which are fundamental to this country,"" said NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson. ""Professional athletes serve as some of our country's greatest role models and we need them to join us to fight for democracy."" #Breaking NAACP Urges Professional Athletes In Free Agency to #AvoidTexashttps://t.co/CNWQ9Es61N ""If you are a woman, avoid Texas. If you are Black, avoid Texas. If you want to lower your chances of dying from coronavirus, avoid Texas,"" Johnson continued in the letter. Texas' abortion law, SB8 (known as the Texas Heartbeat Act), is considered one of the strictest in the country. The law bans almost all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy — even in cases of rape, incest and sexual abuse. The state's law provides for private citizens to enforce the law by suing abortion providers or anyone else who helps a woman break the law, giving the citizens money if they win. Last month, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill that enacts several restrictions on voting. The provisions include: banning Texans from registering to vote using a post office box as their address, banning drive-thru voting, and restricting applications for a mail-in ballot for medical reasons. Texas Gov Greg Abbott signs Senate Bill 1, also known as the election integrity bill, into law. The sweeping bill signed by Abbott further tightens Texas' strict voting laws.

Abbott, who is the only lawmaker mentioned by name in the NAACP's letter, has also been the subject of criticism for lifting COVID-19 restrictions, making masks optional and allowing businesses to reopen. ""Personal vigilance to follow the [safety] standards is still needed to contain COVID. It's just that now, state mandates are no longer needed,"" Abbott said in his Mar. 2 news conference. Earlier this month, Abbott issued an executive order banning vaccine requirements and calling for state lawmakers to pass the ban into law. Also in the open letter, the NAACP leaders said the rights of people of color are being attacked in Texas, attacks Texas NAACP President Gary Bledsoe called reprehensible. Bledsoe says that Texans must stand together and ""use all of the tools at their disposal"" to protect human rights. ""We must fight for our Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees to all Americans,"" he said. There are nine major professional teams across Texas: the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets; the WNBA's Dallas Wings; the NFL's Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys; the MLB's Texas Rangers and Houston Astros; and the NHL's Dallas Stars.

2021-10-28	23:34:13+00:00	Rachel Hinton	suntimes	‘An especially important step?’ Or “a dark day for Illinois?’ Lawmakers’ repeal of parental notification of abortion law rekindles divide	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/10/28/22751249/abortion-parental-notification-repeal-illinois-springfield-pritzker-house-senate	"Legislators in the state House voted to repeal the notification law late Wednesday, sending the measure to Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk. Anti-abortion groups on Thursday denounced the move as “simply appalling” Gov. J.B. Pritzker vowed late Thursday to sign a bill repealing what Democrats in the General Assembly call “the last anti-abortion law” in Illinois — a move Democrats say will protect some of the most vulnerable in the state. “At a time when reproductive rights are under attack across the country, Illinois is protecting those critical reproductive rights,” the governor said in a written statement. “This repeal was essential, because it was the most vulnerable pregnant minors who were being hurt most by this law: victims of rape, incest and physical abuse.” But the promised demise of the decades old law did nothing to end the debate over whether an adult family member should be told when a child gets an abortion. Anti-abortion groups on Thursday denounced overturning the Parental Notice of Abortion Act as a “simply appalling” move by the Legislature, while abortion rights supporters depicted it as a step forward that allows “all Illinoisans, regardless of age,” to have “full legal autonomy to make decisions about what’s best for their bodies.” Eric Scheidler, the executive director of Pro-Life Action League, said the repeal represents a “dark day for Illinois.” “The General Assembly has ignored the rights of parents and the views of most Illinois voters to side with abortion clinics and sex traffickers to keep parents from knowing if their minor daughters get abortions,” Scheidler said in a statement. He went on to say the repeal doesn’t “only set the stage for our daughters to be exploited,” but it also allows “abusers to bring girls to Illinois from throughout the Midwest for secret abortions.” “Our task now is to educate parents on how to protect their daughters, now that the state government has let them down,” he said. Legislators in the state House voted to repeal the notification law and pass the Youth Health and Safety Act late Wednesday, sending the measure to Pritzker’s desk. Arguing that the repeal of “this harmful law” will “keep vulnerable young people safe,” the Democratic governor said late Thursday, “I’ll be proud to sign this legislation.” The Parental Notice of Abortion Act originally became law in 1995, but it didn’t go into effect until 2013 due to legal challenges. It requires a doctor providing care to a young person under age 18 who is seeking an abortion to notify a designated adult family member at least 48 hours before the procedure. During a lengthy debate Wednesday night, state Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, called the notification law “the last anti-abortion law that we have on our books” and said overturning it ensures “we are protecting our most vulnerable young people in Illinois.” Republicans sought to cast the law as not about access to abortion but about parental rights. Overturning the measure, many argued, would be infringing on those rights. In an impassioned speech opposing the bill, state Rep. Avery Bourne, R-Morrisonville, said a vote for the repeal is not just “failing girls — it’s failing good parents.” Similar arguments were made in the Senate during its Tuesday debate of the legislation, which it passed and sent to the House. State Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said experts on human trafficking dispute anti-abortion activists’ claims that there is a link between trafficking and the lack of parental notification for abortion. Earlier Thursday, Jennifer Welch, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Illinois Action, applauded the Legislature’s passage of the repeal, issuing a statement calling it “an especially important step at a time when reproductive rights are under severe attack across the country.” “By passing the Youth Health and Safety Act, Illinois has ensured that young people can choose to involve the people they trust in their health care decisions and are protected from harmful domestic situations and unnecessary judicial interactions,” Welch said. “In short, all Illinoisans, regardless of age, now have the full legal autonomy to make decisions about what’s best for their bodies. We look forward to Governor Pritzker upholding his promise to sign this bill when it crosses his desk.” But Amy Gehrke, the executive director of Illinois Right to Life, said in a statement “minor girls cannot get a body piercing, a tattoo, or even receive an aspirin without parental consent” in Illinois. “Enabling children to have abortions without their parents’ involvement is simply appalling,” she said. The Catholic Conference of Illinois also denounced the repeal, issuing a statement saying the vote “defies public support and is contrary to the legal and moral right of parents to care for their children. The “vote is and will be a tragedy for many families, young girls and so many unborn children,” wrote the group, which serves as the public policy voice for the state’s bishops and the Catholic community. “We pray for the day when every human life may be cherished from conception to natural death.” Know about breaking news as it happens.

2021-10-28	21:35:49+00:00	Unknown	newswise	For comment on restrictive abortion laws: Natali Valdez, author of Weighing the Future: Race, Science, and Pregnancy Trials in the Postgenomic Era	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NewswiseLifenews/~3/-Sj_zGWK1qA/	"As the court battle over the abortion law in Texas continues, Wellesley College women and gender studies professor Natali Valdez is available for comment on how the situation in Texas reveals how unconstitutional restrictions on individual liberties are permitted, promoted, and legally endorsed when it comes to abortions. In one example, Prof. Valdez highlights the contradictory nature of promoting restrictive reproductive rights while simultaneously rejecting mask mandates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Prof. Valdez is the author of Weighing the Future: Race, Science, and Pregnancy Trials in the Postgenomic Era, which will be published by University of California Press this December. More about the book, from University of California Press: ""Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene expression, has been heralded as one of the most promising new fields of scientific inquiry. Current large-scale studies selectively draw on epigenetics to connect behavioral choices made by pregnant people, such as diet and exercise, to health risks for future generations. As the first ethnography of its kind, Weighing the Future examines the sociopolitical implications of ongoing pregnancy trials in the United States and the United Kingdom, illuminating how processes of scientific knowledge production are linked to capitalism, surveillance, and environmental reproduction. Prof. Valdez argues that a focus on individual behavior rather than social environments ignores the vital impacts of systemic racism. The environments we imagine to shape our genes, bodies, and future health are intimately tied to race, gender, and structures of inequality. This groundbreaking book makes the case that science, and how we translate it, is a reproductive project that requires feminist vigilance. Instead of fixating on a future at risk, this book brings attention to the present at stake.""

The law bans 85% of abortions and has a novel enforcement feature that permits third-party lawsuits against abortion providers and those who “aid and abet” the abortion, which is designed to frustrate attempts by the Biden administration to challenge it. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear arguments about the Department of Justice’s ability to do so.
2021-09-30	23:57:51+00:00	James Gordon	Mail	Pelosi bishop calls for massive campaign of prayer and fasting to change Speaker's mind on abortion	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10047527/Pelosi-bishop-calls-massive-campaign-prayer-fasting-change-Speakers-mind-abortion.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490	By James Gordon For Dailymail.com Published: 19:39 EST, 30 September 2021 | Updated: 22:07 EST, 30 September 2021 The Archbishop of San Francisco has called for a 'massive and visible campaign of prayer and fasting' in the hope of persuading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - a churchgoing member of his flock - to rethink her position on abortion. Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, 65, said Pelosi is pushing forward an agenda of what he and pro-lifers have termed 'radical' abortion legislation. He is hoping that such deep prayer may cause the Speaker - who is a practicing Catholic - to think again on pushing forward such legislation. 'Witness the House of Representatives' passage of HR 3755, which would impose abortion on demand nationwide at any stage of pregnancy,' Cordileone said of Pelosi, who represents the San Francisco district, in a statement earlier this week. Archbishop of San Francisco Salvatore Cordileone, 65, has called on all Catholics to pray and fast for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi As a liberal Democrat, Pelosi's stance on some issues has put her at odds with church teaching and conservative Catholic critics. As a liberal Democrat, Pelosi's stance on some issues has put her at odds with church teaching and conservative Catholic critics. She is in tune with the church on caring for the poor, protecting the environment and disarmament but at odds on abortion. Pelosi, 81, has been criticized by many Catholics for her support for keeping abortion legal. 'A conversion of heart of the majority of our congressional representatives is needed on this issue, beginning with the leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I am therefore inviting all Catholics to join in a massive and visible campaign of prayer and fasting for Speaker Pelosi: commit to praying one rosary a week and fasting on Fridays for her conversion of heart.' Pelosi, 81, has been criticized by many Catholics for supporting to keep abortion legal The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, the principal church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco Attendees are seen inside Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption during an in-church Easter Mass celebration in San Francisco, California Archbishop of San Francisco Salvatore Cordileone does not hold back when it comes to airing his views, even if controversial. He is a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage in one of the country's most gay-friendly cities. He has proposed that staff at archdiocese high schools 'affirm and believe' that marriage is between a man and a woman and that sexual relations outside of marriage are 'gravely evil.' In 2015, critics of Cordileone placed a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle, pleading with Pope Francis for a leader with a more inclusive agenda. Then the archbishop's supporters put out their own press release, arguing the man was only defending the church's teachings. Cordileone, 65, is the third of four children born to Mary and Leon Cordileone, a commercial fisherman. He grew up in San Diego and played saxophone in his high school band. In 1981, he received an undergraduate degree in sacred theology and was ordained the following year. He is a lifelong fan of jazz, pro football and baseball. As auxiliary bishop of San Diego, Cordileone helped spearhead passage of the state Proposition 8 gay marriage ban in 2008, which later was struck down in federal court. In 2009, Cordileone was appointed bishop of Oakland and three years later he was named archbishop of San Francisco, an immigrant-rich archdiocese with about half a million Catholics. He was formally installed days after pleading guilty to a reckless driving charge following a drunken driving arrest in San Diego. Since 2011, he has chaired the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops subcommittee that works to oppose same-sex marriage nationwide. In 2014, Cordileone attended the second annual March for Marriage, although House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, both practicing Catholics, called on him to cancel. Cordileone became a lightning rod for additional criticism. He supported a pastor who declared that girls would no longer be allowed to serve at Mass. Then the archdiocese apologized for installing sprinklers at St. Mary's Cathedral to keep the homeless from sleeping in alcoves. In 2015, the archbishop announced that staff at four Catholic high schools must adhere to morality clauses in handbooks that declare homosexual relations, masturbation and viewing pornography as 'gravely evil.' Last week, House Democrats passed the bill Cordileone was referring to with a 218-211 vote. Pelosi has previously defended the bill, entitled the Women's Health Protection Act, after Cordileone described it as 'child sacrifice.' The archbishop has told followers to sign up for the 'Rose and Rosary for Nancy' campaign at BenedictInstitute.org. For every person who decides to sign up, a rose will be sent to Pelosi 'as a symbol of your prayer and fasting for her.' Codileone, who presides over the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco, was appointed archbishop in 2012 and has weighed in on other third-rail political issues. He is a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage in one of the country's most gay-friendly cities. He has proposed that staff at archdiocese high schools 'affirm and believe' that marriage is between a man and a woman and that sexual relations outside of marriage are 'gravely evil.' His most recent statement comes amid a renewed debate on abortion which occurred after the Supreme Court allowed Texas to implement its heartbeat bill a month ago. It means Texas has the strictest anti-abortion law in the country. The bill bans abortions after whenever an ultrasound can detect what lawmakers defined as a fetal 'heartbeat,' which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It includes cases where the woman was impregnated as a result of rape or incest. There is an exception for medical emergencies. 'The archbishop of the city of that area, of San Francisco, and I had a disagreement about who should decide this family size and timing,' Pelosi said in response to the archbishop's statement. 'I believe that God has given us a free will to honor our responsibilities.' The speaker has made no secret of her belief that while efforts are needed to reduce the number of abortions in the United States and to help women faced with problem pregnancies, she believes abortion must remain safe and legal. Pelosi has also used her position as a mother to fend off questions about abortion. 'Speaker Pelosi speaks fondly of her children,' Cordileone said. 'She clearly has a maternal heart. Pope Francis has called abortion murder, the equivalent of hiring a hitman to solve a problem. The solution to a woman in a crisis pregnancy is not violence but love.' 'Please join me in praying the rosary and fasting for a conversion of Speaker Pelosi's maternal heart to embracing the goodness and dignity of human life not only after birth, but in the womb as well.' As a publicly practicing Catholic and a public opponent of efforts to make abortion illegal, some bishops and other Catholics who believe that a politician who supports legalized abortion should not be allowed to receive Communion. Catholicism teaches people should use their free will to reject sin, of which abortion is one. The Catechism of the Catholic Church which discusses abortion says the procedure and act of abortion are abominable crimes.' It reads: 'The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority.' The Catechism warns that 'when the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined.' Women protest outside Texas' capitol on September 1, the day the new law got implemented In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but divided public opinion and has been under attack ever since. The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy. Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment. In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks). Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. One such was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003, which banned a procedure used to perform second-trimester abortions. Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe. McCorvey became a leading, outspoken pro-abortion voice in American discourse, even working at a women's clinic where abortions were performed. However, she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69. Multiple governors have signed legislation outlawing abortion if a doctor can detect a so-called 'fetal heartbeat,' part of a concerted effort to restrict abortion rights in states across the country. Under the ban doctors will be prosecuted for flouting the rules. Abortion-rights supporters see the 'heartbeat bills' as virtual bans because 'fetal heartbeats' can be detected as early as six weeks, when women may not be aware they are pregnant. Anti-abortion campaigners have intensified their efforts since Donald Trump was elected president and appointed two conservative justices to the US Supreme Court, hopeful they can convince the right-leaning court to re-examine Roe v. Wade. Georgia, Ohio, Missouri, and Louisiana have enacted 'heartbeat laws' recently, and Alabama passed an even more restrictive version in May, amounting to a near total ban on abortion from the moment of conception. Other states have similar legislation pending. Similar laws has also been passed in Arkansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Iowa and Kentucky, though they have been blocked by courts from going into effect as legal challenges have been brought against them.

Hayward Planning Commissioner and former Councilman Al Mendall again shines with his voice of reason voting no on yet another housing development along Mission Boulevard. (“Hayward officials approve townhouse development,” Page B1, Sept. 22) This corridor is being overbuilt without concern for traffic congestion, longtime residents and the looming scarcity of water. Does the city not realize the current traffic problems? Re. “State superintendent sets goal to get all third-graders reading by 2026,” Page B4, Sept. 24: The state superintendent’s goal is good. There are many factors in a child developing reading skills. Here are ways in which parents can help their children with reading. A child is born having involuntary movements. Within the confines of the child’s comfort and safety, parents can allow time for their child to move freely while on their back. This allows the child to learn from their own movement and develop a wide range of options from which they can select in organizing themselves to roll over, sit, crawl, etc. In developing these skills a child creates many distinctions including up and down and left and right. These skills are an essential part of what kids need to learn to read. Helping a child to walk or complete any movement skill limits their ability to create full movement and cognitive resources. Give them time to figure it out. They will learn more. As we are exposed to new variants of the virus, we are looking at new ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as a booster shot. President Biden just got his, early this week. He encourages everyone to get the vaccine, and even the third shot if you can. And as someone who wants this pandemic to end as soon as possible, I encourage everyone as well. Although I am not a health expert, I feel like this could be a huge stepping stone to getting back to normal. So please get the vaccine and wear a mask, and if it has been six months after your second vaccine, please check to see if you are eligible for the booster. https://myturn.ca.gov/ Sunday’s Local News – Outrage and sadness over the death of a crossing guard, (“Crossing guard’s death renews city debate about traffic safety,” Page B1, Sept. 26) right next to a story about a 22-year-old who drove into a bike lane and killed an NFL ex-coach (“No charges to be filed in death of ex-coach,” Page B1, Sept. 26). The predictable outcome? “No charges to be filed.” Shoot at someone with a firearm (and miss) and you’ll lose your gun rights and go to jail. Drive distracted, plow America’s most dangerous lethal weapon into another person, kill them, and society says, “Keep driving.” No wonder we kill far more people with cars than guns. Accountability produces good behaviors and lack thereof produces this. Sadly, the vehicle code is written by motorists for motorists, and victims have little recourse. Driving is treated as a right when it is not. It should be like any other privilege – abuse it and lose it. We would all be safer, breathe easier and live longer. Opposition to abortion stems almost entirely from religion. Religious leaders have employed emotional but inaccurate language such as “killing babies” and “murdering children” to manipulate their followers, despite the fact that scripture is silent on the subject. Right-wing politicians have eagerly seized upon this issue because of its emotional appeal. A zygote or fetus is no more a child than an acorn is an oak tree. It is hard to imagine a more oppressive act than to misuse one’s religion to compel a woman to endure an unwanted pregnancy. Four Supreme Court justices who voted not to stay Texas’ obviously unconstitutional law are all Roman Catholics and a fifth was raised Catholic. . This is hardly a coincidence – it is, in fact, the reason they were appointed. It is truly shameful that some justices apparently have greater allegiance to their personal religion than to the Constitution. Here’s an idea: Let women decide abortion restrictions. The first step is to acknowledge that anti-abortion laws don’t prevent abortion, they only prevent safe and legal abortions. There is no universe in which that is any good. The next step is to defer to experts, and that would be women. Men shouldn’t force themselves on women in any way, including laws that restrict abortion.

2021-09-30	22:08:30+00:00	Nicco Pelicano	hilltopviewsonline	Texas does not enforce sex education curriculums, even after criminalizing abortion early on	https://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/24152/viewpoints/texas-does-not-enforce-sex-education-curriculums-even-after-criminalizing-abortion-early-on/	 Nicco Pelicano, Viewpoints Editor|September 30, 2021 ‘Sex Education,’ a Netflix Original tv show was first aired on Jan. 11, 2019 and brings up issues that sex education curriculums in schools need to address. On Sept. 17 the third season of “Sex Education” was released on Netflix. The show is a high school teen drama that has a mission to de-stigmatize teen sex and to educate those who lack a proper and inclusive sexual education in school. This show has become a valuable resource to young people and adults that want to be informed on what sexual education should include and how certain preferences and identities shouldn’t be treated as taboo. The TV show addresses things like gay sex, fetishes, sexually transmitted diseases, pronouns, masturbation, birth control, casual sex, pregnancy, abortion, abstinence, sexual assault, disabilities, and encourages seeking out therapy. With Texas recently passing Senate Bill 8, there is an urgency for people to be educated on how to seek out safe sex. Ironically, Texas is one of the ten states that does not enforce sexual education. Only 24 states require schools to teach sexual education; 37 states require that if sexual education is taught, that abstinence is included; and 26 states require emphasis on abstinence. Texas is also one of the 22 states that does not require sex education to be medically accurate. The Texas State Board of Education voted to change the sex education curriculum in 2020, which allowed middle school programs to teach an “abstinence-plus”curriculum that educates students on birth control, instead of an “abstinence-only” education. The board ignored countless suggestions given at a public testimony event, asking schools to teach about consent, sexual orientation and gender identity; all things that would benefit safe sex and help students feel more comfortable in their bodies. The board left it up to each individual district to decide what they wanted to include in their own sexual education curriculum. The Austin school district came up with their own curriculum, and in 2019 updated it to inform students about sexual orientation, gender identity and consent. It’s quite concerning that the board did not show any interest in any of the LGBTQ+ issues that were brought up at the public testimony event. A study in 2017 highlighted that there is a need for LGBTQ+ inclusivity in school systems because 60% of students felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, and 45% because of their gender expression. Not only is the lack sexual education and inclusivity harming our society, but it’s creating the mentality that there is only one form of sex, and it should be avoided until marriage. This is the same issue with abortion in Texas. SB8 will not prevent abortions from happening, it will prevent safe abortion from happening. As the show “Sex Education” states: “Unfortunately, restraint doesn’t mix very well with raging hormones.” Teaching sexual education that encourages safety and not “restraint” does not mean that it is promoting kids to have sex, it’s just equipping them with the knowledge that they need at an age when they are sexually maturing. It’s ridiculous that Texas is not eager to strengthen their sex education curriculum, but they are quick to criminalize abortions early on. Teaching safe sex may decrease the amount of teen pregnancies and people searching for abortions. Shows like “Sex Education” are important because they raise awareness on issues that shouldn’t be issues at all, while also normalizing conversations about sex that are still very taboo in the school systems today when they have no place to be.

2021-09-30	22:03:07+00:00	Haya Panjwani	thedailycougar	Socialist Alternative, SGA protest Texas’ abortion ban	http://thedailycougar.com/2021/09/30/socialist-alternative-sga-protest-texas-abortion-ban/	Students marched around campus during the Socialist Alliance protest on Sept. 30, 2021 | Katrina Kuwaja/The Cougar Two protests at UH against Texas’ Senate Bill 8 happened Thursday, both advocating against the abortion bill and for women’s reproductive rights in the state. One took place around noon and was hosted by the Houston branch of the political organization, Socialist Alternative. The other was hosted by the Student Government Association at the University at 4 p.m. “This bill makes abortions functionally illegal, as well as allowing vigilantes to sue,” said Social Alternative member and air pollution Ph.D student Alex Spike at the earlier protest. “Making it so that anyone who receives, assists in or even performs an abortion hesitant.” Spike was joined by tens of other UH students who shared the same sentiments. “We want to rebuild the kind of movement that won Roe v. Wade in the first place,” Spike said. “A mass women’s movement, a mass workers movement, that striked, marched and demonstrated for the rights of women.” Demonstrators echoed his sentiments during the noon protest, chanting “our body, our choice” while marching around the M.D. Anderson Library in the rain. “It’s ridiculous that the state gets to tell us as women what we’re allowed or not allowed to do with our own bodies,” teaching and learning junior Leilani Cantu said. During the later protest organized by SGA, director of external affairs David Ngyuen said similar things about why their organization stood up against the Republican dubbed heartbeat bill. “We’re offering our support and solidarity for every woman in Texas,” Ngyuen said. “People are usually against the heartbeat for religious reasons, and the legislature is mostly made up of men, who don’t have pregnancies or abortions. What do they know?” Transgender students, like women and studies junior Ray Mattes, were at the later protest since SGA advocated for all reproductive rights, regardless of sexuality. “Oftentimes, my trans brothers and sisters are forgotten about when lawmakers write laws about pregnancy or abortion,” they said. “Today, I’m here for anyone that can get pregnant, not just who SB 8 says can get pregnant.” Tags: Abortion, Reproductive Rights, SB 8, SGA
2021-09-30	22:00:00+00:00	Unknown	ac-ranger	‘Heartbeat bill’ sparks debate	https://acranger.com/2021/09/30/heartbeat-bill-sparks-debate/	 September 30, 2021 The Ranger Front Page, News 0 Students are speaking out about the new Texas law banning abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. The law is unique in that it deputizes private citizens to sue anyone they believe provided or aided in an abortion after the detection of a heartbeat and collect $10,000 if the lawsuit is successful. Patients now have two weeks after a missed period to confirm the pregnancy, find a provider and schedule the procedure before a heartbeat is detected, making an abortion extremely difficult, if not impossible to attain. “I personally believe this law is not right,” Alely Martinez, a psychology major, said. “Women should have the right to decide what they do with their bodies. I’m not for abortion but I’m not against it. I am pro-choice. You should have the option to do it without punishment.” The United States Supreme Court did not vote to block the Texas ban. “The Supreme Court not hearing it is different from them letting it proceed,” Aaron Faver, a professor of social sciences, said. “An advocate would really need to be putting pressure on the Senate, the House of Representatives and the President, instead of throwing tomatoes at the Supreme Court because they can’t stop state level activity,” he said. The House of Representatives passed a bill Sept. 24 called The Women’s Health Protection Act. The purpose of the bill is to cement the decision of Roe v. Wade, protecting a person’s right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability without interference from state restrictions. The bill needs to pass through the Senate and the President before it is signed into a law that the Supreme Court can defend. “I don’t agree with abortion, but I think everybody has the right to make their decision, and just because I disagree doesn’t mean I should make the choice for anybody else,” Addison Murray, a nursing major, said. At midnight, after the law banning abortion went into effect, many clinics in Texas stopped performing the procedure and stopped making new appointments. “I am personally very against abortion, I’m pro-life because of my religious beliefs,” Sarah Amstutz, a mass media major, said. “However, I don’t agree with the abortion law. I believe that people are going to make some really unhealthy choices to fix unplanned pregnancies that could result in bodily harm, that concerns me.” Amstutz criticized Governor Abbott for signing the controversial bill into law. “I feel like Governor Abbott is trying to have a pissing contest with the rest of the country,” Amstutz said. “I disagree with a lot of his policies. There are children being exposed to COVID in the schools right now, and he said that you can’t make somebody wear a mask and then made abortion after you can detect a heartbeat illegal. To me it just doesn’t make sense.” The law makes exceptions for medical emergencies, but not for cases of rape or incest. During a news conference Sept. 7, Governor Abbott addressed this by saying “Rape is a crime, and Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets.” The United States Justice Department announced Sept. 9 that it would be suing the state of Texas, and a federal judge will conduct a hearing Oct. 1 to review a possible temporary banning of the law. “The law just went into place so there are no damages to prove in the lawsuit yet,” Faver said. “It’s very likely that the Department of Justice will have a difficult time arguing if there are no damages. It’s complicated by the simple fact that it’s so early right now. We’re going to have to wait and see.”

The next thing I knew, he was on top of me, messing with my clothes and not saying anything at all. “What is happening?” I thought. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in shock, just laying there as his weight pressed down upon me. I was confused. I was embarrassed. I was ashamed. I asked myself, was it something that I had done? Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made. But at 18 years old, I knew it was the right decision for me. It was freeing, knowing I had options. Even still, it took long for me to feel like me again until most recently when I decided to give this speech. So to all the Black women and girls who have had abortions and will have abortions, we have nothing to be ashamed of. I knew I was not ready to have another child, so I religiously took my daily contraceptive pill. Despite that, I became pregnant. I consulted with my doctors who told me that any future pregnancy would likely also be high risk to me and the child. Similar to what I had gone through with Janak. I very much wanted to have more children, but I simply could not imagine going through that again. For me, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice, the most difficult I’ve made in my life, but it was my choice and that is what must be preserved for every pregnant person. I’m sharing my story even though I truly believe it is personal and really nobody’s business, and certainly not the business of politicians. But I’m compelled to speak out because of the real risks of the clocks being turned back to those days before Roe vs Wade, to the days when I was a teenager and had a back alley abortion in Mexico. A lot of girls and women in my generation didn’t make it. They died from unsafe abortions. In the 1960s, unsafe septic abortions were the primary killer, primary killer of African-American women. WASHINGTON — Representative Cori Bush, a Democrat from Missouri, is known on Capitol Hill as a nurse, a pastor, a Black Lives Matter activist and a member of a “squad” of progressive women lawmakers. On Thursday, she told a House panel that she is also a rape survivor who had an abortion after she was attacked on a church trip when she was 17. Ms. Bush said she is no longer ashamed. “In the summer of 1994,” she declared, “I was raped, I became pregnant and I chose to have an abortion.” With the right to abortion under threat after a major Supreme Court setback, Ms. Bush was one of three Democratic congresswomen who sat at a witness table to share their personal experiences with terminating a pregnancy. The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform reflected a sharp cultural divide, with Republicans accusing Democrats of “glorifying and normalizing” abortion, and Democrats making their point — that abortion is a decision best left to women and their doctors — in matter-of-fact terms. Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, got an abortion when she was a young mother caring for a very sick child and struggling to recover from postpartum depression so severe that she considered suicide. Her doctor told her that carrying a second child to term would be extremely risky for both her and the baby. “I very much wanted to have more children,” she told the panel, “but I simply could not imagine going through that again.” Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, was the first Black cheerleader in her high school and a promising student with good grades when she got pregnant before abortion was legal in the United States. Her mother sent her to a friend in Texas, who took her for a “back alley” abortion at a clinic in Mexico. “A lot of girls and women in my generation didn’t make it — they died from unsafe abortions,” she said. But Representative Kat Cammack, a freshman from Florida and the lone Republican member of Congress to testify, offered a starkly different personal story, telling her colleagues that she “would not be here” if her mother, who suffered a stroke after having her first child, had not rebuffed a doctor’s advice to have an abortion. “You can imagine the feeling, the disappointment, the struggle, the internal anguish that my mother felt,” Ms. Cammack said, adding, “She chose life. That wasn’t an easy decision for a single mom.” The debate over abortion rights has flared up again on Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court refused last month to block a Texas law prohibiting most abortions. With other states rushing to enact similar restrictions, and the court, now dominated by conservatives, preparing to take up a case that could overturn the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, Democrats are making the issue a centerpiece of their campaign strategy for next year’s midterm elections. They are also seeking to advance legislation that would codify the Roe decision; the House last week passed the Women’s Health Protection Act to do just that. But the bill has little chance of advancing in the closely divided Senate, where Republicans are strongly opposed. Thursday’s hearing, which also featured a virtual appearance by the women’s rights activist Gloria Steinem, demonstrated the depth of that partisan split. Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky, insisted that Congress must continue to ban taxpayer-funded abortions, while Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, said she felt “profound sorrow” for women who terminated their pregnancies. “Instead of glorifying this awful act of desperation, we ought to grieve for the tens of millions of Americans who never had a chance to take their first breath, to see their mother’s face,” Ms. Foxx said. A recent NBC poll found that a majority of Americans — 54 percent — believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That included majorities of women, suburbanites and people living in the Northeast. But majorities of evangelical Christians, rural Americans, and Southerners said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. The hearing, entitled “A Dire State: Examining the Urgent Need to Protect and Expand Abortion Rights and Access in the United States,” also revealed how the issue of abortion is intertwined with America’s racial divide. Ms. Bush described how belittled she felt, as a Black teenager, “in being told that if I had this baby, I would wind up on food stamps and welfare.” Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is Black, spoke in her opening statement of how denying access to abortion affects people of color, including “our lowest income sisters; our queer, trans and nonbinary siblings.” “These bans,” she asserted, “are rooted in patriarchy and white supremacy.” Later in the hearing, Dr. Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Texas who was invited to testify by Republicans, pushed back, noting that abortion rates are much higher among Black women than among whites. “It’s not racist to want to save those children,” she said. But it was Ms. Bush, a freshman who became a Democratic star last year when she unseated a veteran Democrat in a primary, whose testimony was especially raw. She spoke of how, not long before her 18th birthday, she met an older boy, who was about 20, on a church trip to Jackson, Miss. They spoke on the phone and he invited himself to her room; by the time he showed up, she had already gone to bed. She let him in quietly, thinking they would talk, she said, and “the next thing I knew he was on top of me messing with my clothes and not saying anything at all.” She never heard from him again, despite repeated attempts to get in touch after learning she was pregnant. She felt confused, embarrassed and ashamed, she said, and blamed herself. “Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made, but at 18 years old I knew it was the right decision for me,” said Ms. Bush, who also tweeted about her abortion on Wednesday, saying it was a story she had never “fully told publicly” before. “To all the Black women and girls who have had abortions and will have abortions, we have nothing to be ashamed of,” she said. “We live in a society that has failed to legislate love and justice for us, so we deserve better, we demand better, we are worthy of better.”

As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. WASHINGTON — In a combative speech on Thursday, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. defended several of the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on what critics call its “shadow docket,” saying the news media had created the impression that “a dangerous cabal is deciding important issues in a novel, secretive, improper way in the middle of the night, hidden from public view.” He addressed the recent decisions in unusual detail, rejecting, for instance, what he said was the “false and inflammatory claim that we nullified Roe v. Wade” in early September by allowing a Texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks to come into effect. “We did no such thing, and we said so expressly in our order,” he said, quoting from it. Indeed, the majority in the 5-to-4 ruling said it based its decision on procedural grounds and did not address the constitutionality of the Texas law. The effect of the ruling, however, has been to deny abortions to most women in Texas. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the majority’s unsigned order “illustrates just how far the court’s ‘shadow docket’ decisions may depart from the usual principles of appellate process.” “Without full briefing or argument, and after less than 72 hours’ thought,” she wrote, “this court greenlights the operation of Texas’ patently unconstitutional law banning most abortions.” Justice Alito’s speech, at the University of Notre Dame, was largely devoted to addressing the “shadow docket,” which he called a loaded and misleading phrase. “The catchy and sinister term ‘shadow docket’ has been used to portray the court as having been captured by a dangerous cabal that resorts to sneaky and improper methods to get its ways,” he said. “This portrayal feeds unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court and to damage it as an independent institution.” Justice Alito used a different term to refer to cases decided by the court in response to emergency applications: the “emergency docket.” He said the court had long considered such applications after only thin briefing and without oral arguments, often resolving them with little or no reasoning in late-night orders, because prompt action was needed. Justice Alito compared the court’s procedures to the ones used by emergency medical technicians called to the scene of an accident. “You can’t expect the E.M.T.s and the emergency rooms to do the same thing that a team of physicians and nurses will do when they are handling a matter when time is not of the essence in the same way,” he said. He acknowledged that the court had been issuing many such rulings, attributing the spike to applications from the Trump administration after lower courts blocked its programs and three kinds of cases prompted by the pandemic: changes to election rules, requests from prisoners fearing exposure to the virus and restrictions on houses of worship. Justice Alito said the court had applied its usual standards “in the controversial cases that have come up in the last few weeks,” discussing recent emergency rulings rejecting the Biden administration’s policies on asylum and evictions and allowing the Texas law to come into effect. The Texas abortion law. After the court let Texas effectively outlaw most abortions in a 5-4 decision, the justices heard arguments that could allow it to reverse course. The case puts Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the spotlight as the most likely member to switch sides. The Mississippi abortion case. The court is poised to use a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks to undermine and perhaps overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. A major decision on guns. The justices will consider the constitutionality of a longstanding New York law that imposes strict limits on carrying guns in public. The court has not issued a major Second Amendment ruling in more than a decade. A test for Chief Justice Roberts. The highly charged docket will test the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who lost his position at the court’s ideological center with the arrival last fall of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. A drop in public support. Chief Justice Roberts now leads a court increasingly associated with partisanship. Recent polls show the court is suffering a distinct drop in public support following a spate of unusual late-night summer rulings in politically charged cases. The court’s three liberal members dissented in all three cases. They were joined in dissent in the Texas case by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Justice Alito addressed many of what he said were the most common criticisms of the court’s procedures in addressing emergency applications. It was “rank nonsense,” for instance, he said, to argue that the court often issued its orders late at night to avoid attention. He added that there was not enough time for the court to issue full opinions. Still, he said, “I submit that in the three recent cases that have stimulated most of this criticism, perceptive and fair-minded readers can easily understand the grounds for our rulings in all of those cases.” Justice Alito said rulings on emergency applications did not create precedents. In April, however, the Supreme Court chastised the federal appeals court in California for failing to follow its earlier rulings on emergency applications concerning restrictions on religious gatherings during the pandemic. In the weeks leading up to the court’s return to the bench on Monday, three of its other members — Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Amy Coney Barrett — have also made public remarks. They spoke in general terms, often defending the court against charges of partisanship. Justice Alito’s comments were considerably more pointed.

The court is expected to issue a series of opinions this week, including a decision today in favor of Goldman Sachs to avoid a class action lawsuit by investors. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)[/caption] Morgan Marietta, University of Massachusetts Lowell The Supreme Court begins its annual term on Oct. 4, 2021, with a packed agenda highlighted by three claims of violations of constitutional rights. One is about religious rights. A second is about gun rights. And the biggest case this year is a challenge to abortion rights. Several states are asking the justices to reconsider Roe v. Wade – the landmark 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right for a woman to terminate a pregnancy, regardless of the moral beliefs of other citizens. The case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. The Mississippi legislature passed the Gestational Age Act in 2018, banning abortions after 15 weeks. The law was challenged and is currently on pause until the Supreme Court hears arguments on Dec. 1, with a decision expected by June 2022. Since 1973, the Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right for a woman to make her own decision about bearing a child, up until the point of viability – when the fetus can survive on its own outside of the womb, which is at approximately 24 weeks of gestation. However, several states have passed laws intentionally challenging the constitutionality of Roe by lowering the threshold to 15 weeks, as in Mississippi, or six weeks, as in Texas. The Republican legislatures of those states are hoping that a more conservative Supreme Court will overturn or modify the 1973 ruling. Public opinion on abortion has remained remarkably stable in an era of political polarization. From the 1970s to now, around 20% of Americans have consistently believed abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. Another slightly larger group has believed it should be legal under all circumstances. And the largest group of Americans – around 50% – has favored legal availability with some restrictions. The core legal question since 1973 – and especially with the case before the court – is what kind of restrictions should be permissible. The justices will consider the longstanding debate over whether the Constitution protects a right to choose, or instead whether abortion falls outside of the realm of rights and squarely in the realm of majority rule to be decided by regular legislation. But there is also a second question addressed in Roe, which is more often overlooked: whether a fetus is a person who also has rights, or instead whether a fetus is an aspect of the pregnant woman, whose rights are predominant. The Constitution provides no guidance on that second critical question, which is at the heart of the Mississippi case. The court in 1973 decided that personhood does not emerge at conception nor wait until birth, but emerges during the course of the pregnancy at the point of viability. Hence, according to Roe, states could ban abortion after 24 weeks, but not before. As an observer of constitutional politics, I suspect that if the court were ruling on this question for the first time, likely six of the justices would assert that the Constitution contains no specific right to abortion, instead leaving that decision to each state. They may also believe that decisions on the emergence of personhood, and therefore when abortion could be limited, are best left to individual states. But Roe has been in force for almost 50 years and is often considered a “super precedent,” with even more force than other longstanding decisions. Chief Justice John Roberts has displayed a high regard for following precedent, while some of the more conservative justices like Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas believe that precedent is no reason to prolong what they believe to be an error. Whether the court will leave Roe undisturbed, overturn Roe entirely, or maintain the principle of abortion rights while allowing states to lower the threshold of fetal personhood from 24 weeks to 15 weeks – or lower – is difficult to predict. The court first recognized a fundamental right of citizens to bear arms for personal protection in the landmark rulings in D.C. v. Heller in 2008 and MacDonald v. Chicago in 2010. What has not been decided is how far the right extends outside the home. Can local governments limit the right to just protecting the home, or do citizens have a broader right to carry concealed weapons while out in society? In New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the plaintiffs argue that the Second Amendment requires something more than the current practice of limiting licenses to carry concealed firearms to rare circumstances. Technically a private citizen can be granted a permit, but the stringent requirements in New York mean that in practice almost no licenses are issued. In the plaintiffs’ view, a rule requiring a “proper cause” to award a license – such as being in imminent danger from a known source – limits the right to select people, rather than applying the Bill of Rights to ordinary people. The court will have to draw the lines regarding where, and to whom, the Second Amendment extends. A clear trend on the current court is toward greater protection of religious liberty. This traces back to the controversial Hobby Lobby ruling in 2014, which allowed religious businesses to claim exemption from health care laws they say infringe on their beliefs. Most recently, in Fulton v. Philadelphia in June 2020, the court ruled in favor of a religious charity that had been excluded from the city of Philadelphia’s adoption programs because the organization refused to serve same-sex couples who wished to adopt or foster a child. Many of the recent rulings expanding religious liberty were decided 7-2 or even 9-0 among the justices, with only the two most liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, sometimes dissenting. Now Sotomayor stands alone in rulings that would go 8-1, or, with the two more moderate liberals dissenting as well, 6-3. However, when religion meets public education, the divide on the court becomes more dramatic between the conservatives and the liberals. In 2020, five justices struck down the exclusion of a US$150 tax credit for private school tuition when applied to a religious school, saying that if a state provides a benefit regarding private secular schools, it cannot deny the same opportunities to parents who choose religious schools. Four justices dissented on the grounds that any funding that benefits religious schools violates the First Amendment by creating impermissible entanglement between the government and religion. This year, the court must decide if the same principle applied in the scholarship ruling applies at a larger scale. The state of Maine, where many communities do not have local public schools, reimburses a student’s tuition to attend private schools. But it doesn’t pay the same tuition for private religious schools. In Carson v. Makin, the court will determine if a state may deny a public benefit on the grounds that it will be used to pay for explicit religious instruction, or whether the First Amendment demands entirely equal financial treatment of religious and secular private schools. In each of these three major cases, a now conservative-dominated court – especially after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was replaced by Amy Coney Barrett – may move American constitutional law in a new direction.

He used the event to respond to growing outrage about the court's use of the ""shadow docket,"" in which it weighs in on ongoing cases without oral arguments or extended opinions. Adam Serwer of the Atlantic has been among those to recently call out the court's increasingly aggressive use of the shadow docket. Writing about its recent decision to allow a Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy to go into effect, Serwer wrote: ""The conservative majority on the Supreme Court was so eager to nullify Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent securing the right to abortion, that it didn't even wait for oral arguments."" Without naming Serwer or the Atlantic, Alito latched on to this quotation and attempted to refute it. ""Put aside the false and inflammatory claim that we nullified Roe v. Wade,"" Alito said. ""We did no such thing, and we said that expressly in our order. I quote: 'The applicants now before us have raised serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law at issue. ... this order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas's law...'"" He continued: ""So, the statement is flatly wrong, and the suggestion that we should've held oral argument is ridiculous."" Alito's response is wholly unresponsive to Serwer's actual claim. First, most clearly, Serwer did not suggest that the justices should've held oral argument before issuing their order. His point, quite obviously, is that at the very least the court should wait to hold oral arguments and before doing something as upending precedent on abortion law. That's what the court did by allowing the Texas ban to go into effect based on a technicality, even though there were clear immediate harms caused by the obviously unconstitutional law. Alito's cheap shot here shows either a lack of interest in taking criticism seriously or poor critical reading skills, neither of which are qualities one would hope to see in a Supreme Court justice. More to the point, though, Alito's claim that the court didn't nullify Roe v. Wade because it didn't address the constitutionality of abortion bans doesn't hold up either. If Serwer had claimed that the court had overturned Roe, Alito would arguably be right on a technicality. But nullifying isn't the same as formally overturning precedent. Serwer's point is that the court effectively rendered Roe's protections void in Texas, which is undoubtedly true. The Texas ban, which clearly flies in the face of Roe, is in force and is in fact impeding the ability of women to get abortions. That's what it means for the protection of a legal right to be nullified. Alito's argument that the majority in the Texas case claimed it wasn't making a decision on the constitutionality of the law doesn't change the fact that rights have been nullified. And the claim that the decision was solely based on the technical aspects of the law, and not the justices' beliefs about the merits of case, doesn't pass the laugh test. There's no serious doubt that the court would've acted differently if, for example, Massachusetts had used a similarly structured law to ban gun ownership. Serwer, responding to Alito, noted that the justice's comments offered more evidence for an argument he made in a separate article. In that piece, Serwer wrote:"

Cori Bush, D-Mo., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Barbara Lee, D-Calif., got candid with their personal stories about their own abortions. Bush had hers after being raped and becoming pregnant as a teenager. “In the summer of 1994, I was raped. I became pregnant and I chose to have an abortion,” she said before the House Oversight Committee. Bush recounted her church trip to Jackson, Miss., when an older boy she had met asked if he could come to the room she was staying in with a friend. She invited him in, expecting they would continue talking and laughing as they had done earlier in the day. “But the next thing I knew, he was on top of me,” Bush recalled. “I was frozen in shock as his weight pressed down upon me. When he was done, he got up, he pulled up his pants and without a word he left. That was it.” She never heard from him again. Dabbing at tears, Bush said she eventually missed her period and discovered she was pregnant. Knowing she couldn’t raise a child on her own at that time, she decided to have an abortion. “Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made,” Bush said. “But at 18 years old, I knew it was the right decision for me.” At the abortion clinic, she said, she overheard the staff saying, “‘They ruined their life and that’s what they do’ — ‘they’ being Black girls like us.” “To all the Black women and girls who have had abortions and will have abortions, we have nothing to be ashamed of,” Bush said. “We live in a society that has failed to legislate love and justice for us.” Watch below, followed by the testimony of Reps.

The argument, which infuriated women’s rights groups, came up in a court filing by Texas’ top legal officials as they fend off a lawsuit from the US government. The Department of Justice is currently suing to stop the enforcement of Senate Bill 8, Texas’ near-total ban on abortions, and has cited its impact on interstate commerce as one reason to block it. In a legal brief filed on Wednesday, Texas said that argument doesn’t apply. “In this case, the federal government does not bring a commerce claim, nor does it cite any actual evidence that the Texas Heartbeat Act burdens interstate commerce,” the state said. “What evidence that does exist in the record suggests that, if anything, the Act is stimulating rather than obstructing interstate travel.” The document then refers the reader to sections “noting increase in Texas women traveling to Oklahoma” and “same for Kansas”. The American Civil Liberties Union expressed outrage over the brief. “As thousands of pregnant Texans seeking essential, time-sensitive medical care are forced to flee the state in desperation, Texas is now claiming its blatantly unconstitutional abortion ban has ‘stimulated’ interstate travel,” Julia Kaye, an attorney at the ACLU, told Bloomberg. “It is appalling that Texas is trying to capitalize on the catastrophe anti-abortion politicians created.” Texas passed SB8 in May, banning all abortions after a fetus’ heartbeat can be detected. Typically, that happens about six weeks into a pregnancy – a point at which many women might not yet know they’re pregnant. In late August, abortion providers appealed to the US Supreme Court to block the law, but the high court declined to intervene. Then, in September, the Biden administration stepped in. Arguing that SB8 violated Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion, the Department of Justice asked a federal court in Texas to stop the law’s enforcement. “The Act is clearly unconstitutional under longstanding Supreme Court precedent,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “The United States has the authority and responsibility to ensure that no state can deprive individuals of their constitutional rights through a legislative scheme specifically designed to prevent the vindication of those rights.” US District Judge Robert Pitman is scheduled to consider both sides’ arguments at a hearing on Friday.

2021-09-30	20:22:56+00:00	Danielle Campoamor	Independent	What a ‘pro-life’ doctor said at the abortion hearing today was unacceptable, medically and morally	https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/abortion-texas-skop-hearing-moayedi-b1930167.html	Dr Skop didn’t tell the truth about abortion complications, how people report feeling after accessing terminations, or why people have late-term abortions in the first place Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile On Thursday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing on abortion access in the country, discussing in particular the recent six-week abortion ban enacted in Texas. Numerous individuals provided testimony, including Democratic Representative Cori Bush; Gloria Steinem; the co-founder of the Reproductive Justice Movement, Loretta Ross; We Testify abortion storyteller and Texas Equal Access Fund worker, Maleeha Aziz; Dr Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas OB-GYN and abortion provider; and Dr Ingrid Skop, a member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. And surprise, surprise: The anti-choice doctor told a story littered with inaccuracies. It would have been easy to fixate on Dr Skop’s wildly odd habit of gendering a fetus as male. That alone warrants some considerable pause. But what she said about the safety of abortion care, both surgical and medical, as well as how people feel before and after their abortions, and who is qualified to provide abortion care were, to my mind, outrageous. One of Dr Skop’s claims was that medication abortion is inherently dangerous and can result in a number of complications, especially if it’s a self-managed medication abortion. Yet a recent 2020 study found that no-test medication abortions provided via telemedicine are “effective, safe, acceptable, and improve access to care.” Dr Skop then claimed that there is a lack of accurate data regarding abortion complications — which is simply not true. To be clear, abortion is incredibly safe — safer than getting a tonsillectomy or your wisdom teeth removed; safer than a colonoscopy; fourteen times safer than childbirth. In addition to its proven safety, scores of data on abortion-related risks and complications exist and are readily available for anyone — Dr Skop included — who cares to look. Dr Moayedi even felt compelled to remind Dr Skop, when answering questions during the hearing, that “spreading medical [misinformation] can result in the loss of board certification.” “It is incorrect that this data is not tracked appropriately,” Dr Moayedi continued. “In our state of Texas, this data is tracked at a clinic level and it is legally required that, every single day, we report to the state how many people have had abortions and if there were any complications.” She added that she even has to report heath conditions that are not related to abortion care, but occur up to 20 years later in the life of a person who has had an abortion in the past. Dr Skop went on to say that people who have abortions later in pregnancy “have late abortions” because they “just got tired of saying, ‘No, I want to keep the baby’.” That feels like an affront to every person who has had an abortion later in pregnancy, and it’s also not backed up by research. People have abortions later in their pregnancies for two factual reasons: a fetal abnormality was detected that has made their pregnancy not compatible with life, or they have faced numerous barriers to healthcare that made it impossible for them to access an abortion earlier. As a recent example of this, when Governor Greg Abbott banned abortion care under the guise of public safety during the Covid-19 pandemic, Texas clinics that provide abortion care saw an increase in people seeking abortions later in pregnancy once those clinics were allowed to re-open. If all of that wasn’t enough, Dr Skop also claimed that people who have abortions come to her distraught; that their mental health suffers as a result of obtaining abortion care; and that many women kill themselves after having an abortion. Now for the truth: An all-encompassing Turnaway Study found that people who have abortions report feeling relieved, and five years later were steadfast in their belief that their decision to have an abortion was the right one. “We found no evidence of emerging negative emotions or abortion decision regret; both positive and negative emotions declined over the first two years and plateaued thereafter, and decision rightness remained high and steady,” the researchers wrote in an article for Social Science & Medicine. “At five years post-abortion, relief remained the most commonly felt emotion among all women.” The same study found that denying abortion care is what causes harm, not obtaining it. People who were unable to have a wanted abortion were more likely to experience serious pregnancy complications, more likely to stay tethered to abusive partners, more likely to suffer anxiety and the loss of self-esteem, and more likely to experience chronic pain. Additionally, the children they already have were more likely to experience developmental delays. Given her hardline views, it’s perhaps no surprise that Dr Skop refused to answer as to whether or not she would force her own daughter to carry a pregnancy that resulted from a rape. As the committee member who asked her that very question pointed out, answering honestly could highlight the hypocrisy of the anti-abortion movement: What they would do for themselves and their families are the very things they seek to deny others. Dr Skop would not answer as to whether or not she supported SB8, though she did say that she “may” have submitted written testimony in support of the law. Instead, she stated that she supported a state’s right to regulate abortion care in accordance with the will of the people. If it’s true that she cares so deeply about the will of the people, however, Dr Skop should emphatically and unapologetically support access to abortion care — because the vast majority of people in this country support it.

2021-09-30	20:22:42+00:00	Jeremy Stahl	Slate Magazine	AOC Shattered the Most Damaging Abortion Myth At The S.B. 8 Hearing	https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/aoc-texas-abortion-ban-hearing.html?via=rss	On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on S.B. 8, the Texas law that bans abortion after six weeks and has effectively overturned the protections of Roe v. Wade in the state. The Republican Party has studiously avoided discussing the consequences of the ban, which contains no exceptions for rape or incest, apparently because they view it as a political loser. But at Thursday’s hearing, Republican House members called a witness who was willing to stand up for the law, Dr. Ingrid Skop, a Texas-based member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Speaking up in favor of the law means defending the provisions forcing some survivors of sexual assault and incest to carry fetuses to term. As committee members noted, the official position of recent Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump was to seek abortion bans except in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the life of the mother. That, however, is not S.B. 8. You might think that as a Republican witness, Skop would oppose Texas’ provisions forcing assault survivors to carry fetuses to term, or at least avoid discussing the question as so many of the law’s supporters try to do. Instead, Skop repeated the ludicrous position of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that six weeks—or when most women might just be finding out they are pregnant—was enough time for a sexual assault survivor to get an abortion. Nobody in the hearing room was more disgusted by these remarks than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ripped Skop’s “shameful” position to shreds in the most powerful moment of the entire hearing. First, it’s important to have a sense of the exchange that led to Skop’s response. Specifically, under intense questioning from Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Skop would not say whether she would want her own daughter to have access to an abortion after six weeks in the horrific event that she were raped. Raja Krishnamoorthi: Now my wife and I have a daughter, Dr. Skop, and one of our greatest fears in life is that she would be sexually assaulted or raped. Now I understand that you have a daughter, right? Ingrid Skop: I do have a daughter. Krishnamoorthi: If, God forbid, your daughter were raped, do you believe that your daughter should be forced to carry the fetus to term? Skop: In the event—and I just want to say for the record that the stories that I heard from women today of their abortions make me very sad. I feel for every woman that has been through that horrendous situation and had to make that horrendous decision. I am working for a world where women do not ever have to address that decision, but I would say that in the case of a rape women generally know that they’ve been raped and a woman can find out if she is pregnant— Krishnamoorthi: I’m just asking you a simple question, Dr. Skop, in the case even after a detectable fetal heartbeat, under S.B. 8, were your daughter raped, would you believe that she should be forced to carry the baby to term as required by S.B. 8? Skop: S.B. 8 gives enough time for a woman who knows she’s been raped to determine that she is pregnant. A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. After Skop’s evasion on the specific personal question, Krishnamoorthi asked whether there should be an exception for rape and incest in the Texas law when none exists and when Abbott recently said he would oppose such a modification to the law. Skop was more precise in her answer, expanding on her position that two weeks after a missed period is enough time for a victim of sexual assault to get an abortion. Here’s that exchange: Krishnamoorthi: You don’t want to answer the question, you’re being evasive and this is the hypocrisy which characterizes people like you having an opinion as to how you would treat your own daughter, but forcing other daughters, and sisters, and women in the state of Texas to go through a wholly entirely different experience. In 2019, the Texas Department of Safety reported more than 14,000 rapes in the state of Texas, and most experts believe unfortunately the actual number of rapes far surpasses the number of reported rapes. Now, ma’am, do you believe that after a fetal heartbeat is detected, there should be any exception for rape and incest? Skop: I think there’s adequate time in this law for a woman who’s been raped to discover that she’s pregnant, and if she wants to terminate the pregnancy, I think that she has time to do it. Again, this has been one of the most outrageous pieces of misinformation about S.B. 8 offered by the law’s mostly silent Republican advocates and here it was getting a hearing on a national stage in the House of Representatives. Ocasio-Cortez was, to say the least, not pleased. The New York congresswoman explained in precise detail—and using her own life as an example—why Skop’s statement was so anti-science, wrong, and damaging to survivors of sexual assault. I need to correct and address an assertion that was made not too long ago, this idea, this myth that, first of all, that this law S.B. 8 provides ample time for a victim of abuse to seek abortion care. Because once again we’re in a room of legislators who are attempting to legislate reproductive systems that they know nothing about. Six weeks pregnant—and it’s shameful that this education needs to happen, because this conversation shouldn’t even be held in a legislative body—six weeks pregnant is two weeks late for one’s period. When you are raped, you don’t always know what happened to you. And I speak about this as a survivor. You are in so much shock. And by the way, people who commit abuse and victims and survivors of sexual assault are overwhelmingly assaulted by someone they know. And this myth that it’s some person lurking on a street or in a parking lot waiting to sexually assault you, that myth only benefits the abusers in power that want you to think that that’s how it happens. It’s your friend, it’s a boyfriend, it’s a boss, it’s a legislator. You are in so much shock that what happened to you, sometimes it takes years to realize what actually went on. So this idea that victims know in the two weeks that they might be late for their period? I’m a buck-15. I’m 115 pounds, you look at me funny, I’m two weeks late for my period. And you’re expecting me to know that I’m pregnant? Or the stress of a sexual assault. That makes you two weeks late for your period, whether you’re pregnant or not. Unbelievable. Unbelievable that the Republican side would call a witness so irresponsible and hurtful to survivors across this country. Honestly. [Y]our constituents [deserve] an apology. Republican representatives on the committee spent much of the rest of the hearing trying to stand up for Skop and decry Krishnamoorthi’s question and Ocasio-Cortez’s clarifying factual statements as outrageous personal attacks. Notably, none actively tried to repeat and validate Skop’s statements that six weeks is enough time for a sexual assault survivor to realize she’s pregnant and get an abortion. While Skop at least had the decency to try to defend the law on its merits, once again, the Republicans legislators seemed to be aware of just how shameful and damaging S.B. 8 is in practice and that it’s better to avoid addressing the actual substance of the law in favor of pushing distracting partisan attacks.

The state had asked for the recusal in a court filing Wednesday, arguing that during a hearing on the abortion cases, District Court Judge Gregory Todd expressed personal bias and prejudice against the state regarding a separate case. That case relates to a new law changing the way judicial vacancies are filled. Todd recused himself Thursday afternoon and was replaced with Judge Michael Moses. Planned Parenthood of Montana filed the lawsuit in August seeking to block four laws, including three that are set to go into effect on Oct. 1. The laws would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, restrict access to abortion pills and require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound. The state’s move to disqualify Todd from the case was an “outrageous delay tactic,” said Martha Stahl, president of Planned Parenthood of Montana. Todd previously said he would issue a ruling on whether to grant a preliminary injunction on or before Thursday. If granted, such an injunction would have stopped the laws from going into effect as scheduled while the legal challenge was underway. It remains unknown of Moses will consider the injunction Thursday before the law goes into effect. Planned Parenthood has argued the laws violate Montana’s constitutional right to privacy, which they say protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks of pregnancy. The suit names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, as a defendant. The state is represented in the case by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. A spokesperson for Knudsen did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The state has argued the laws should be allowed to go into effect, and that they will “help minimize the medical risks” during pregnancy. But medical experts and abortion advocates broadly dispute that the new laws would make the procedure safer. The laws were passed earlier this year by the Republican-dominated Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte, who last November became Montana’s first Republican governor in 16 years. His Democratic predecessors blocked previous attempts to limit abortion access. Montana joins several other GOP-led states in passing additional restrictions on abortion access this year.

(WTVQ) – In response to a national strategy by extremist politicians to ban abortion that took a drastic turn in Texas this month, Democratic Kentucky state Representatives Mary Lou Marzian and Lisa Wilner announced Thursday they have pre-filed a bill to secure safe and legal access to abortion for all Kentuckians. Representative Nima Kulkarni, Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, Kentucky Health and Justice Network, and other supporters joined in speaking of support of the legislation and demanding access to abortion for all Kentuckians. This legislation would enshrine a right to abortion and preserve legal protections recognized by Supreme Court decisions like Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey for the people of Kentucky, at a time when access to abortion is hanging by a thread, the supporters said in a statement. It also protects the right to access affordable contraception, nullifies existing anti-abortion laws, and prohibits the state from interfering in these rights, they added. “We have no doubt that similar legislation will be introduced by the Kentucky General Assembly,” said Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “The impact of this heinous abortion ban in Texas cannot be understated. It will overwhelmingly harm Black and Latino people, people with low incomes, and people in rural areas, who already face immense barriers to health care. Kentucky has already gone above and beyond to restrict access to abortion, even during a devastating pandemic. Kentucky is one of eleven states with a “trigger law” that means if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Kentuckians stand to lose access altogether. This is the most dangerous time for abortion access in decades. The time to act is now.” “In the nearly 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided, abortion opponents have waged a war on women that has regrettably chipped away their constitutional right to choose what happens to their own body,” said Marzian, the bill’s chief sponsor. “Texas’s recent legislation to essentially create an anti-abortion ‘police force’ of private citizens, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to stop its implementation, opens a dangerous new front that we must stop from taking place in Kentucky and elsewhere. The legislation we are filing will do that.” “Our country is facing a maternal mortality crisis, and pregnancy-related death in Kentucky is much higher than the national average,” said state Rep. Lisa Willner, the bill’s primary co-sponsor. “Pregnancy outcomes are worse and death rates are higher in states with restrictive abortion policies. It’s critical to protect pregnant people by protecting Roe.” “There is no doubt the General Assembly will consider a bill next year identical to what Texas enacted, and that would all but shut the door on abortion access here in Kentucky,” said House Democratic Caucus Leader Joni Jenkins. “I am proud to support Representatives Marzian and Willner’s bill, because I believe it is vital we fight to protect a right that has been the law of the land for almost five decades.” “I am proud to stand with my legislative colleagues today and to support their bill,” Rep. Kulkarni added. “The Texas law is an affront to all women, but falls disproportionately on minorities and those who have limited incomes and who live in rural areas. Simply put, we cannot let what happened there happen here.” “Reproductive freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy. The government should not be allowed to force a person to remain pregnant against their will,” said Jackie McGranahan, policy strategist for the ACLU of Kentucky. “Legislation based on the Texas abortion ban is already being drafted. Wealth and well-connected Kentuckians will always be able to access abortion; it is marginalized communities who will suffer under a ban on abortion care. Reproductive decisions should be left to the pregnant person and their family, period.” This year alone, the General Assembly introduced seven bills attacking abortion access, three of which became law. On the last day of the Kentucky General Assembly passed House Bill 91. This bill is a proposed amendment to the state’s constitution that would add a new section stating that it, “does not secure or protect a right to abortion or funding of abortion.” The amendment will go to the voters on the November 2022 ballot. The legislation announced Thursday will be considered during the 2022 Regular Session of the General Assembly, which convenes at the Capitol in early January.

2021-09-30	19:39:37+00:00	Unknown	41nbc	Congressional members share own abortion stories at hearing	https://www.41nbc.com/congressional-members-share-own-abortion-stories-at-hearing/	Three Democratic members of Congress on Thursday offered deeply personal testimony about their own abortions as a congressional committee examined how to respond to conservative states that are passing laws limiting abortion access. Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said she was raped on a church youth trip. Rep. Barbara Lee of California said she received a “back-alley” abortion in Mexico after a teenage pregnancy. And Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington said she opted for an abortion after being told her pregnancy would be high risk for her and the baby. “Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made, but at 18 years old, I knew it was the right decision for me,” Bush told the House Committee on Oversight Reform. The hearing comes weeks after a Texas law took effect that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy with no exception for rape or incest. Other conservative states are considering similar measures. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court is weighing the fate of a Missouri law that bans abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, also with no rape or incest exceptions. And, the U.S. Supreme Court in December will hear arguments over a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The hearing also looked at what the federal government can do to ensure abortion access. Options include ending the Hyde Amendment, which restricts government funding for most abortions, and passing a law guaranteeing a woman’s right to an abortion. The House passed that measure last week, but Republican opposition would almost certainly doom it in the Senate. Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, said the majority of Americans support abortion rights. “But with a hostile Supreme Court, extremist state governments are no longer chipping away at constitutional rights — they are bulldozing right through them,” Maloney said. Republican Rep. James Comen of Kentucky said the oversight committee should focus on problems with President Joe Biden’s administration, not a state matter over which it “has absolutely no jurisdiction.” Another Republican, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said abortion “only compounds the sorrow.” “Whether a pregnancy is planned or unplanned, or even the result of horrific circumstances, ending that child’s life with an abortion to empower or protect the, quote, freedom, end quote, of the mother is not an answer,” Foxx said. Bush, a 45-year-old first-term lawmaker from St. Louis, testified that she had just graduated from high school in the summer of 1994 and went on a church youth trip to Mississippi. She said she befriended a man who was about 20. She said they flirted and he asked to go to the room she was sharing with another girl. Her roommate was already asleep when the man showed up. “I answered the door and quietly told him he could come in, imagining that we would talk and laugh like we had done over the phone,” Bush said. “But the next thing I knew, he was on top of me, messing with my clothes, and not saying anything at all.” When it was over, Bush said, she was “confused.” “I was embarrassed, I was ashamed,” she said. “I asked myself, ‘Was it something I’d done?’” About a month later, soon after she turned 18, Bush learned she was pregnant. “To all the Black women and girls who have had abortions or will have abortions — know this: We have nothing to be ashamed of,” Bush said. Jayapal said her first child, Janak, now 25, was born prematurely and weighed less than 2 pounds, which resulted in medical conditions that frequently required his hospitalization. Jayapal said other stresses combined with the sick baby resulted in postpartum depression so bad that she contemplated suicide. She said that when she became pregnant again, she consulted with doctors “who told me that any future pregnancy would likely also be high risk to me and the child, similar to what I had gone through with Janak.” “I very much wanted to have more children,” she said, “but I simply could not imagine going through that again.” Ending the pregnancy was “the most difficult choice I’ve made in my life, but it was my choice,” Jayapal said. Lee became pregnant at age 16 in the mid-1960s. Abortion in California was illegal at the time so a family friend helped send her to a “back-alley clinic in Mexico,” she said. She had no ill effects from the procedure, but she said many other women weren’t so lucky in that era. “In the 1960s, unsafe septic abortions were the primary killer — primary killer — of African American women,” Lee said. A Republican lawmaker had her own personal story about an abortion that didn’t happen. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida said her mother suffered a stroke while pregnant with Cammack’s older sister. Years later, when pregnant with Cammack, Cammack’s mother was urged by doctors to have an abortion. “But because of her strength,” Cammack said, “she chose life.” 
2021-09-30	19:26:14+00:00	Brittanie Shey	eater	These Houston Hospitality Veterans Are Teaming Up to Fight Back Against Texas’s Abortion Law	https://houston.eater.com/2021/9/30/22702218/houston-hospitality-workers-fighting-texas-abortion-ban-womens-march-ill-have-what-shes-having	Despite the potential for backlash, some of the industry’s most prominent players are protesting SB8 On Thursday, Houston bartender Lindsay Rae is planning a party at her Midtown drinking den Two Headed Dog. Instead of the usual birthday celebration or themed cocktail party, Rae and others plan to make signs — and connections — with people planning to attend the Houston Women’s March on Saturday, October 2 to protest the state’s highly restrictive new abortion law. The march is one of many happening throughout the country this weekend in response to a series of laws already enacted or in the works that restrict reproduction rights. The Texas law, known as SB8, went into effect on September 1, and prohibits all abortions after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law also makes it possible for anyone suspected of aiding a person in obtaining abortion to be sued. Texas’s law has already become the model for similar legislation in several other states. Tonight’s event, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., will give people an opportunity to meet march buddies, discuss safe protest strategies, and build camaraderie amongst those planning to attend the march on Saturday. Padma Lakshmi and Gail Simmons of reality TV show Top Chef, which is currently filming in Houston, will lead the march. “Maybe you want to attend the march, but you’re afraid, or you don’t have anyone to go with,” Rae says. Her plan for Saturday is to meet up with other industry folks at the march, and spread the word of I’ll Have What She’s Having, a Houston organization that supports women in the male-dominated hospitality industry. It’s just one of several events organized by IHWSH in response to SB8. Earlier this summer, the group, led by Rae and pastry chef Valerie Trasatti, hosted a series of happy hours benefitting abortion funds in the state. More recently, IHWSH organized a campaign called the 1973 Project to raise funds and awareness that abortion is an essential component of health care. IHWSH was initially founded in 2017 as a response to the election of Donald Trump, according to co-founder Lori Choi. Although she is now a vascular surgeon, Choi worked in the hospitality industry for years before attending medical school. Her husband, Ryan Pera, is also a chef with Agricole Hospitality. In talking to Pera’s female coworkers, she realized that women in the hospitality industry were working in a male-dominated field — much like she was in medicine. “I realized we needed to be offering women an opportunity to network,” she says. So she teamed up with a handful of prominent chefs and restaurateurs, including Erin Smith of Feges BBQ and Lisa Seger of Blue Heron Farms, to launch I’ll Have What She’s Having. Shortly after the organization was founded, it shifted to providing access to medical services like mammograms and birth control to marginalized people in the hospitality industry. That is especially important considering that, according to Choi, more than two-thirds of people in the service industry do not have health insurance. IHWSH has been providing support to those workers for a few years, but really went into overdrive in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when many workers found themselves out of a job due to stay-at home ordinances. When the state reopened, restaurant employees had little help from the government in navigating the pandemic. “Hospitality workers were already at a disadvantage,” Rae says. “We had a government that did not help you, did not assist you, then told you that you had to go back to work with no support.” For the 1973 Project, the organization is asking for donations of $19.73 — a number that represents the year Roe V. Wade was decided — and to pose for a selfie with a piece of masking tape, for the makeshift labels used in restaurant kitchens daily, somewhere on their body proclaiming their opposition to SB8. A number of Houston’s hospitality veterans have already donated and posed for the project, including restaurateur Benjy Mason, chef Monica Pope, Keisha Griggs of Ate, and restaurant consultant Jess Timmons, Money raised will be distributed to Texas abortion funds, including Lilith Fund, West Fund, and Clinic Access Support Network, which provides transportation to people seeking abortions. At least one Houston bar owner is making the trek to Washington, D.C. for the official rally there. Mary Ellen Angel, who owns Downtown charity bar Angel Share, will leave Friday for the nation’s capital. She wants to stand on the steps of the Supreme Court and be seen. “It’s super important that the people who are making these laws see the people that they affect,” Angel says. While she’s away, Angel Share will act as a gathering spot for demonstrators after the march. Even thought the bar usually opens at 4 p.m., her staff all agreed that they wanted to come to work early and open the bar at noon to support the movement. In addition, the bar will highlight four reproductive health nonprofits during the month of October. At times, Angel worries about the ramifications of speaking out against the bill. “It is scary to me as a business owner, that there might be some pushback,” she says. “But this issue is core to my identity as a person.” One Houston restaurant has already seen backlash. Sarah Lieberman, owner of Bellaire breakfast spot Dandelion Cafe, says she’s been targeted by a troll after posting her support of the 1973 Project. A commenter on the restaurant’s Instagram starting expressing views in support of the ban, and soon, the discussion turned nasty. Leiberman says that after she blocked the woman from commenting, that person took to Facebook and Yelp to falsely claim the restaurant was infested with roaches. After posting about the incident earlier this week, the cafe received an outpouring of support. For Rae, the event highlights the importance of “third places,” outside of work and home where people interact. “Historically, taverns and other third places have played a significant role in helping change the world,” she says. “We have some of the most prominent people in the food and beverage industry speaking out,” she says. “That law is not Texas.

2021-09-30	18:10:31+00:00	ByReuters	Post	Women across Latin America march in favor of abortion rights	https://nypost.com/2021/09/30/women-across-latin-america-march-in-favor-of-abortion-rights/	 Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. MEXICO CITY, Sept 28 – Thousands of women demonstrated in several Latin American cities on Tuesday to commemorate the global day of action for access to safe and legal abortion, in a region where the procedure is fully permitted only in a handful of countries. In Mexico City, women marched to the historic center under the gaze of police with shields and riot helmets. Authorities put up protective fences on some major buildings and monuments that in the past have been spray-painted during demonstrations. “I still don’t know if I want to be a mom, but I want to have the right to decide,” read a sign held by a young woman with a green scarf around her neck. Earlier this month Mexico’s Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to criminalize abortion and, shortly after, the government said that those jailed on accusations of having terminated their pregnancy would be released. Hundreds of other women marched in other parts of Mexico, including in the cities of Cuernavaca and Veracruz. Every year, thousands of women in Latin America die from unsafe abortions at a time when teenage pregnancies and sexual violence continue to increase in the region. In Colombia, where abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, risks to the life of the mother, or birth defects, some 800 women marched towards the center of Bogota. “Women are reminding states and societies that we’re full citizens, not second-class, and that we have the right to abort, to voluntarily interrupt pregnancy, to decide about our bodies, about our lives, and about our maternity wards,” said Ita Maria Diez, a leader of the Bogota demonstration. A march was also held in Chile, where the lower house of Congress agreed to debate a bill to decriminalize abortion up to 14 weeks after pregnancy. Scores of people in El Salvador waved green flags and marched through San Salvador en route to Congress to demand a loosening of the country’s “strict” abortion laws. Holding up banners saying “it’s our right to decide” and “legal abortion, safe and free,” the Salvadoran protesters sought to pressure legislators to ease one of the world’s strictest abortion laws, which prohibit termination of pregnancy in cases of rape and even if the mother’s life is at risk. The proposals taken to the Salvadoran Congress have been named “Beatriz Reform,” in honor of a young woman who in 2013 openly called for an abortion to save her life as she suffered from a chronic disease, which took her life four years later. “We are asking for minimum measures to add to the Penal Code to guarantee the life and integrity of women,” Morena Herrera, a prominent Salvadoran feminist, told journalists. “It does not require constitutional reform. It can be done now and if it is true that there is independence of powers, the Legislative Assembly must respond,” she added. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele earlier this month ruled out any amendments to the abortion laws as part of controversial constitutional changes his government is planning. But several out of more than 20 Latin American nations still ban abortion outright, including El Salvador, which has sentenced some women to up to 40 years in prison.
2021-09-30	17:46:34+00:00	Unknown	dailycaller	Biden Nominee Argued Brutal Partial Birth Abortion Procedure Should Not Be Banned Simply Because Of ‘Grossness’	https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/30/biden-nominee-argued-brutal-partial-birth-abortion-procedure-should-not-be-banned-simply-because-of-grossness-atul-gawande/	President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead global health development at the U.S. Agency for International Development formerly suggested that brutal partial birth abortion techniques should not be vilified over other abortion procedures, saying, “Grossness is not a good objection.” “Grossness is not a good objection,” wrote Atul Gawande in a 1998 Slate op-ed. “Lots of operations are gross–leg amputations, burn surgery, removal of facial tumors, etc. But that does not make them wrong.” A partial birth abortion is one in which an abortion doctor delivers a living baby until the baby’s head is outside the mother’s body, then punctures the back of the baby’s head, “removing the baby’s brains,” according to the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Biden’s Health and Human Services Director Xavier Becerra has repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the procedure is illegal, though the highly discussed piece of legislation passed Congress in 2003, was signed by former President George W. Bush, and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court as constitutional in 2007. (RELATED: Republican Senators Push Biden Nominee Becerra On His Abortion Record) Gawande also describes a partial birth abortion in gruesome detail in his 1998 op-ed, acknowledging that late-term abortions are “disturbing” since the unborn baby is ” big now–like a fully formed child.” “Partial-birth abortion is, if anything, less grotesque,” he wrote, comparing partial birth abortion to Dilation and Evacuation procedures. “The fetus is delivered feet first. To get the large head out, the doctor cuts open a hole at the base of the fetus’s skull and inserts tubing to suck out the brain, which collapses the skull.” The Biden nominee’s frankness in discussing partial birth abortion is reminiscent of a very different period in the fight over abortion — advocates of the past few years are much less likely to discuss abortion techniques with such candor.

(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for The New Yorker) Gawande suggested that if partial-birth abortions are “too gruesome to allow,” perhaps dilation and evacuation abortions (in which the unborn baby is vacuumed out of the mother’s womb) are also too gruesome to allow. “And that’s the inevitable next target for pro-life advocates,” he wrote. (RELATED: Biden Nominee Once Argued Partial Birth Abortion Should Not Be Banned Simply Because Of ‘Grossness’) “Two of my obstetrician friends, both strongly pro-choice, told me that, even when it is a mother’s life at stake and abortion is absolutely necessary, doing the D and E feels ‘horrible,'” the Biden nominee wrote. “We imagine, as we look in the fetus’s eyes, that there is someone in there. And if there were, any elective late abortion–even by induction–would be wrong, though D and E and partial-birth abortion would seem especially cruel.” Gawande questioned whether there is “someone in there,” noting that Roe v. Wade has led advocates and activists to “focus on whether the fetus is viable.” The Biden nominee said that when he has a breathing patient on life support, the patient is not necessarily a “living person anymore.” What matters, he said, is whether his brain is functioning.

Even for viable anencephalics, there’s no purpose to providing treatment. We let them die.” “Whether the fetus is in the womb or out, big or small, does not matter, either,” he added. “But the size and appearance of the late-term fetus make us imagine that it has become a sensate, aware creature–and makes many supporters of first-trimester abortion uncomfortable with later-term ones.” Gawande said that the unborn baby “does become a distinctly different being” somewhere between 22 and 25 weeks. (RELATED: Biden’s HHS Secretary Falsely Says There Is ‘No Law’ Dealing Specifically With Partial Birth Abortion) “We need more in-depth study to identify this critical juncture,” he wrote. “That’s because most people would feel that it is wrong to do elective abortions–abortions when the health of the mother is not at risk and the fetus is not seriously deformed–beyond that point. The current debate glosses over these issues.” “There’s no good reason to single out partial-birth abortion–or any technique,” he concluded. “From the pro-lifers’ standpoint, banning it will not actually save a single fetus. And for abortion-rights supporters, it is only an invitation to inconsistency.” Gawande did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Cori Bush (D-MO) talks to members of the press after a House Democrats closed-door meeting at the U.S. Capitol September 27, 2021 in Washington, DC.Alex Wong/Getty During a Thursday House Oversight Committee hearing about state laws blocking abortion access, representatives shared personal stories about their abortions in condemnation of SB 8, the Texas law that serves as a near-total ban on abortion. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) talked about a church trip she’d taken, the summer after graduating high school, during which she was raped by an older man who was “a friend of a friend.” Rep. Cori Bush: ""My abortion happened on a Saturday…Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made. But at 18 years old, I knew it was the right decision for me…in the summer of 1994 I was raped, I became pregnant and I chose to have an abortion."" pic.twitter.com/cKykuIIZOz — CSPAN (@cspan) September 30, 2021 “I was confused, I was embarrassed, I was ashamed,” Bush said. “I asked myself, was it something that I had done?” She realized she was pregnant after missing her period and flipped through the phone book to find an abortion provider. Sitting in an abortion clinic while nine weeks pregnant, Bush recalled, she didn’t know how she would have been able to support a child at just 18 years old. Overhearing the clinic workers talking, Bush recalled their comments about the patients: “They ruined their life,” she remembered hearing. “That’s what they do.” “’They‘ being Black girls,” Bush said. “I was being talked to like trash and it worsened my shame.” Stressing the disproportionate harm the Texas law poses for communities of color and LGBTQ people, Bush said, “We live in a society that has failed to legislate love and justice for us.” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) talked about her upbringing in El Paso, Texas, where she attended a Catholic school that failed to teach comprehensive sex education. Even today, Texas middle schools are not required to teach birth control methods beyond abstinence. When she faced an unwanted pregnancy, she received help from a family friend who knew of services in Mexico and decided to cross the border for an abortion. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) talked about how she chose to get an abortion after doctors told her that her pregnancy would be high risk for her and the child. “I did not suffer from living in a state that does not allow pregnant people to make these choices,” she said. A Texas-based OB-GYN, Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, said abortion has almost completely stopped in Texas and that health care providers are confused. “My colleagues are asking if they’re still allowed to treat an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage,” Moayedi said. “They’re worried they will have to delay life-saving care for people who are very sick.” They also called on the Senate to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which the House moved forward last week. The bill would guarantee abortion rights granted under Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and block the enactment of laws, rules, or standards that go against those rights. Rep. Judy Chu, who sponsored the legislation, said, “Everyone deserves equal access to comprehensive and safe reproductive healthcare, no matter where they live, free from political interference.” She added, “But anti-abortion extremists have been working ever since the passage of Roe v. Wade to put abortion service out of reach for as many Americans as possible. Texas’ SB 8 is just the latest example.” Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi."

Ted Cruz says he supports NBA players who don’t want to get the vaccine Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, shared support for four NBA players and their decision to not get the coronavirus vaccine. Cruz, who is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, said he supported Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins, Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal and Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac. “I stand with Kyrie Irving. “I stand with Andrew Wiggins. “I stand with Bradley Beal. “I stand with Jonathan Isaac.

The COVID-19 vaccine has been a source of contention in the NBA recently. It began last week when the NBA denied a request by Wiggins for a religious exemption for the vaccination. This immediately raised questions about Wiggins’ eligibility to play for the Warriors at home because San Francisco requires vaccines for some workers, as I wrote for the Deseret News. Then came the Rolling Stone piece that reveals some conspiracy theories — such as one where “‘secret societies’ are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for ‘a plan of Satan,’” per Rolling Stone — are circulating through the NBA. That said, about 90% of NBA players are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to reports. And some stars, like Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, have spoken about why they got vaccinated.

Ghana in 2017 recorded about 200,000 abortions, an equivalent to a national abortion rate of 26.8 per 1000 women between 15 and 49 years, a study by the Guttmacher Institute has revealed. Guttmacher Institute is a leading research and policy organisation committed to advancing sexual reproductive health and rights in the United States of America. The study was conducted through Abortion Incidence Complications Methodology (AICM) approach and estimates 71 per cent of the abortion cases were illegal and unsafe, despite the nations’ relatively liberal abortion law and efforts to expand access to safe abortion services. Mr. Raphael Godlove Ahenu, the Chief Executive Officer of Global Media Foundation (GloMeF), a human rights and media advocacy non-governmental organisation, highlighted the outcome of the study at a forum to mark this year’s International Safe Abortion Day held in Sunyani. The International Safe Abortion Day, formerly known as the Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion falls on September 28 and is celebrated globally to campaign for the decriminalization of abortion in Latin America, the Caribbean, and other parts of the world. Mr. Ahneu said complications from unsafe abortions contributed substantially to maternal morbidity and mortality in the country. “The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Ghana remains high, estimated at 310 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017. An estimated 23 per cent of all pregnancies in Ghana in 2017 ended in abortion”, he added. Mr. Ahenu called for the repeal of laws and policies that restricted the right to safe abortion and post-abortion care services in the country. “This would greatly ensure that post-abortion care is readily available in an emergency, especially at the community levels”, he said. Mr. Ahenu noted in spite of efforts by the government to incorporate safe abortion into policy, trainings, and guidelines, illegal and unsafe abortions continued to occur in the country clandestinely. “Complications from unsafe abortions contribute substantially to maternal morbidity and mortality in Ghana”, he indicated. But, Mr. Ahenu added Ghana, though was a signatory to the Maputo Protocol, it was yet to fully implement policies like medical abortion services, even though the Protocol made abortion a human right for women in Africa. He said complications associated with unsafe abortions had serious public health implications for the nation as they increase maternal mortality and morbidity, and advocated a policy guideline to promote and make safe abortion services readily available at all health facilities to reduce maternal deaths. Mr. Ahenu called for a national discourse towards reducing unsafe abortion, and highlighted the importance of enhancing knowledge and access to Reproductive Health Services, including contraceptives, safe abortion services, and post-abortion care. He entreated the GHS to expand access to safe and legal abortion as well as post-abortion care services in the country by increasing the number of trained providers and approved facilities, to greatly reduce complications and deaths from unsafe abortions. “GloMeF under it’s Safe Abortion for All Project is helping to increase access to post-abortion care and safe abortion services to decrease the negative impacts of unsafe abortion by improving access to legal abortion services by 2030”, Mr. Ahenu said.

2021-09-30	16:46:51+00:00	by: JIM SALTER, Associated Press	wishtv	Congressional members share own abortion stories at hearing	https://www.wishtv.com/news/politics/congressional-members-share-own-abortion-stories-at-hearing/	(AP) — Three Democratic members of Congress on Thursday offered deeply personal testimony about their own abortions as a congressional committee examined how to respond to conservative states that are passing laws limiting abortion access. Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said she was raped on a church youth trip. Rep. Barbara Lee of California said she received a “back-alley” abortion in Mexico after a teenage pregnancy. And Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington said she opted for an abortion after being told her pregnancy would be high risk for her and the baby. “Choosing to have an abortion was the hardest decision I had ever made, but at 18 years old, I knew it was the right decision for me,” Bush told the House Committee on Oversight Reform. The hearing comes weeks after a Texas law took effect that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy with no exception for rape or incest. Other conservative states are considering similar measures. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court is weighing the fate of a Missouri law that bans abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, also with no rape or incest exceptions. And, the U.S. Supreme Court in December will hear arguments over a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The hearing also looked at what the federal government can do to ensure abortion access. Options include ending the Hyde Amendment, which restricts government funding for most abortions, and passing a law guaranteeing a woman’s right to an abortion. The House passed that measure last week, but Republican opposition would almost certainly doom it in the Senate. Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, said the majority of Americans support abortion rights. “But with a hostile Supreme Court, extremist state governments are no longer chipping away at constitutional rights — they are bulldozing right through them,” Maloney said. Republican Rep. James Comen of Kentucky said the oversight committee should focus on problems with President Joe Biden’s administration, not a state matter over which it “has absolutely no jurisdiction.” Another Republican, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said abortion “only compounds the sorrow.” “Whether a pregnancy is planned or unplanned, or even the result of horrific circumstances, ending that child’s life with an abortion to empower or protect the, quote, freedom, end quote, of the mother is not an answer,” Foxx said. Bush, a 45-year-old first-term lawmaker from St. Louis, testified that she had just graduated from high school in the summer of 1994 and went on a church youth trip to Mississippi. She said she befriended a man who was about 20. She said they flirted and he asked to go to the room she was sharing with another girl. Her roommate was already asleep when the man showed up. “I answered the door and quietly told him he could come in, imagining that we would talk and laugh like we had done over the phone,” Bush said. “But the next thing I knew, he was on top of me, messing with my clothes, and not saying anything at all.” When it was over, Bush said, she was “confused.” “I was embarrassed, I was ashamed,” she said. “I asked myself, ‘Was it something I’d done?’” About a month later, soon after she turned 18, Bush learned she was pregnant. “To all the Black women and girls who have had abortions or will have abortions — know this: We have nothing to be ashamed of,” Bush said. Jayapal said her first child, Janak, now 25, was born prematurely and weighed less than 2 pounds, which resulted in medical conditions that frequently required his hospitalization. Jayapal said other stresses combined with the sick baby resulted in postpartum depression so bad that she contemplated suicide. She said that when she became pregnant again, she consulted with doctors “who told me that any future pregnancy would likely also be high risk to me and the child, similar to what I had gone through with Janak.” “I very much wanted to have more children,” she said, “but I simply could not imagine going through that again.” Ending the pregnancy was “the most difficult choice I’ve made in my life, but it was my choice,” Jayapal said. Lee became pregnant at age 16 in the mid-1960s. Abortion in California was illegal at the time so a family friend helped send her to a “back-alley clinic in Mexico,” she said. She had no ill effects from the procedure, but she said many other women weren’t so lucky in that era. “In the 1960s, unsafe septic abortions were the primary killer — primary killer — of African American women,” Lee said. A Republican lawmaker had her own personal story about an abortion that didn’t happen. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida said her mother suffered a stroke while pregnant with Cammack’s older sister. Years later, when pregnant with Cammack, Cammack’s mother was urged by doctors to have an abortion. “But because of her strength,” Cammack said, “she chose life.” © 2021 Circle City Broadcasting I, LLC. | All Rights Reserved. 
2021-09-30	16:24:03+00:00	Unknown	TIME.com	What History Teaches Us About Women Forced to Carry Unwanted Pregnancies to Term	https://time.com/6103001/baby-scoop-era-abortion/	As the full implications of Texas’s severe abortion law come into view, experts on reproductive rights are justifiably concerned about a potential increase in unsafe abortions. And while the specter of coat hangers may seem anachronistic in an era where medication abortions can be safely self-managed at home, we know that some women who lack access to health care will take desperate measures to avoid the physical, psychological, emotional, social and economic trauma of being compelled to gestate and give birth against their wishes. But others will not be able to avoid it, and that means women being forced to continue carrying unwanted pregnancies to term. We’ve been here before, of course—most recently in the decades from 1945 to 1973, now known as the “Baby Scoop” era, when more than 1.5 million pregnant girls and women in the U.S. were sent away to maternity homes to surrender children in secret. By the 1960s, more than 200 homes for unmarried pregnant women were operating across 44 states. Parents, often counseled by religious leaders, sent their daughters away to these homes to wait out their pregnancies and relinquish their babies to “legitimate” married couples. Meanwhile, the young men who shared equal responsibility for the pregnancies typically carried on with their lives unfettered by social stigma. Read More: Why Must Women Wait for the Supreme Court to Decide What We Can Do With Our Bodies? While philosophies and missions varied, most maternity homes tailored their services not to meet the emotional and psychological needs of frightened young pregnant women but to accommodate the social anxieties of their overwhelmingly white, middle-class and working-class parents: A strict commitment to privacy meant that no one—not the neighbors or the altar guild or the company boss—would find out about the pregnancy or the secretive closed adoption. Both the child and the birth mother would be better off in what the home framed as a win-win scenario: the baby would be saved from the stigma and shame of illegitimacy, and the birth mother could put the unpleasant chapter behind her and make a fresh start. There was just one problem: Almost no one asked the young women themselves about their wishes. During the Baby Scoop era, an unmarried pregnant woman sent away to a maternity home had no say in whether she would carry her pregnancy to term, no agency over the birth itself and, once the child arrived, no choice about whether she could raise the baby. According to their own accounts in oral histories collected by researchers like Ann Fessler, birth mothers sent to these homes received little to no counseling on what to expect from labor and delivery, and were not advised of their legal rights once the child was born. They endured psychological abuse from nuns and nurses, and gave birth alone in sometimes terrible conditions. Many women still foggy from the effects of anesthesia following a birth under “twilight” sleep were coerced into signing papers terminating their parental rights. Those who wanted to keep their babies were threatened with financial penalties, since many homes only covered the cost of prenatal care and room and board if the child was surrendered. Some women who refused to give up their babies were committed to mental institutions. Unsurprisingly, the promise that birth mothers would surrender their babies and “move on” turned out to be a lie. They did not go back to normal; they did not forget. Many were haunted for the rest of their lives by the uncertainty of their child’s fate and were prevented by strict adoption statutes from acquiring any information that might ease their minds. Far from a youthful mistake they could leave in the rearview mirror, the experience became a pivotal life event that influenced all their major decisions going forward—whether to marry, have more children, finish school, forge careers. Many experienced the symptoms associated with unacknowledged and complex grief: depression, anxiety, shame, difficulty with intimacy and attachment, serious unexplained illnesses and struggles with addiction. Proponents of contemporary open, legal adoption are correct to jump to the defense of what can be a loving and healthy arrangement, provided all parties can consent to it. But the adoptions of the Baby Scoop-era babies were not the source of the birth mothers’ trauma. Instead it was the loss of agency—the fact that someone else was deciding for these women what would happen to them—that did so much damage. Unplanned pregnancies create a complex constellation of decisions that resist a tidy narrative. Sometimes they are the result of love, sometimes casual sex and sometimes rape. That was true in 1945, in 1965, and it’s true today. Given a different set of circumstances—access to legal abortion and open, non-coercive adoptions—the women caught up in the Baby Scoop era might have chosen to terminate their pregnancies, carry their pregnancies to term and make a plan for adoption, or keep and raise their children, and they would have made these decisions for all kinds of individual and personal reasons. In that more humane version of midcentury America, the decisions would have been theirs alone. Fifty years later, cultural norms around unplanned pregnancy and single motherhood have shifted in ways that make the world of maternity homes seem like ancient history. But women still pay a lifelong price when they are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. According to the results of the landmark Turnaway Study, which followed 1,000 women denied access to abortion over 10 years, women forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term have a higher incidence of serious pregnancy complications—including eclampsia and death—and have higher odds of remaining with abusive partners. They are, staggeringly, four times more likely to be living below the federal poverty level; they had lower credit scores, carried more debt and endured more bankruptcies and evictions. All these factors are compounded for women who face intergenerational poverty and/or systemic racism. The fortunate women who avoid these outcomes nonetheless must make a plan for adoption or raise the child they didn’t wish to have in a country where access to health care, affordable child care and paid family leave are spotty to nonexistent for many households. Women with unwanted pregnancies are no longer physically warehoused, but many of them are still trapped by what happens when they lose the freedom to choose whether to give birth. Laws like S.B. 8 guarantee that more women will face the same formidable future. Contact us at letters@time.com.
2021-09-30	15:51:28+00:00	Nikki Schwab	Mail	Sotomayor speaks of 'disappointments' after Texas abortion ruling	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10045769/Sotomayor-speaks-disappointments-Texas-abortion-ruling.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490	By Nikki Schwab, Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.com Published: 10:09 EST, 30 September 2021 | Updated: 12:27 EST, 30 September 2021 Liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday 'there are going to be a lot of disappointments in the law' as she encouraged young lawyers to be 'lobbying forces' and change laws they don't like. Sotomayor, who was appointed to the Court by President Barack Obama in 2009, was speaking virtually at a diversity summit hosted by the American Bar Association, which was covered by The Washington Post and CNN. . Her comments come just weeks after she released a fiery dissent, responding to the Court's conservative majoritys' decision not to step in and stop Texas' restrictive abortion law from going into effect. 'There's going to be a lot of disappointments in the law, a huge amount,' Sotomayor told the ABA seminar participants. 'As you study cases and look at outcomes you disagree with, it can get frustrating.' 'Look at me, look at my dissents,' she noted. 'At least I have a vehicle, I have a dissent mechanism that I can explain how I feel,' she added. In the Texas case, Sotomayor got liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan to sign on to her slapdown. Chief Justice John Roberts also voted alongside the liberals, but wrote his own dissent. He was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, but has turned into a key swing vote. 'The Court's order is stunning,' she wrote. She called the Texas law - which bars abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and doesn't include carve-outs for incest and rape - 'flagrantly unconstitutional.' 'Last night, the Court silently acquiesced in a State's enactment of a law that flouts nearly 50 years of federal precedents. Today, the Court belatedly explains that it declined to grant relief because of procedural complexities of the State's own invention,' Sotomayor said. Women protest outside Texas' capitol on September 1, the day the new law got implemented Sotomayor added that a 'majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.' 'I can't change Texas' law, but you can,' she continued. 'You can, and everyone else who may or may not like it can go out there and be lobbying forces in changing laws that you don't like.' 'I'm pointing out to that when I shouldn't because they told me I shouldn't,' she commented, referencing how justices aren't supposed to be speaking publicly about cases that are before them. 'But the point is, there are going to be a lot of things you don't like,' she warned. The Supreme Court's new term kicks off Monday, with liberals fearing that the conservative majority will finally doom the 1973 landmark decision, Roe v. Wade. Before reexamining the Texas statute, the Court will look at a restrictive abortion law from Mississippi. The comments below have not been moderated.

2021-09-30	15:47:21+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	alternet	Texas AG argues women are 'stimulating' interstate commerce for out-of-state abortions in pushback against DOJ litigation	https://www.alternet.org/2021/09/texas-ag-abortion-lawsuit/	"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is pushing back against the U.S. Department of Justice's litigation challenging the Lone Star state's anti-abortion law, which aims to discourage doctors and abortion providers from performing abortion procedures after a fetal heartbeat is detected. In legal briefs filed on Wednesday, September 29, Paxton claimed the DOJ did not point out any ""actual evidence that the Texas Heartbeat Act burdens interstate commerce."" To defend the state's law, Paxton focused on the increase in Texas women taking trips out of state to obtain abortions. In short, Paxton argues that the new anti-abortion law has encouraged women to travel outside of the state to get the procedure. ""What evidence that does exist in the record suggests that, if anything, the Act is stimulating rather than obstructing interstate travel,"" Paxton said, as he claimed there has been an influx of Texas women specifically seeking to travel to Kansas and Oklahoma to undergo abortions. An earlier court filing also includes remarks from a representative for the abortion provider Trust Women, which has locations in both Kansas and Oklahoma. Speaking to the courts, the clinic organization's leader claimed both clinic locations have seen an uptick in call volume with many of the latest calls coming from Texas residents. ""About two-thirds of our [Oklahoma City clinic] patient appointment calls now come from Texas patients seeking abortions that are unavailable throughout their home state,"" the leader of the abortion provider stated. Back in 2019, the abortion clinic reportedly recorded only 25 abortion patients that had traveled from Texas for abortion procedures. However, now the provider claims ""approximately half of the calls"" to its Wichita, Kan., office are coming from Texas. The latest Justice Department lawsuit is just one of many that have been filed in federal and state courts to challenge the new abortion law. Per CNN: Paxton also ""emphasized in the new briefs that as the law was written, federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear the dispute and he rejected arguments made by the Justice Department that the individuals who are able to bring civil suits are acting as 'agents' of the state."""
2021-09-30	15:30:36+00:00	Alison Durkee	Forbes	Lawmakers Tell Stories Of Their Own Abortions To Push For Federal Protections	https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/09/30/lawmakers-tell-stories-of-their-own-abortions-to-push-for-federal-protections/	 Three Democratic lawmakers testified Thursday about their personal experiences with abortion to emphasize the importance of protecting the federal right to the procedure, part of a broader push by Democrats in Congress to pass abortion protections and combat state restrictions like Texas’ near-total ban on the procedure. Rep. Cori Bush wipes away a tear as she prepares to testify on Sept. 30, 2021, during a House ... [+] Oversight Committee hearing. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) testified to the House Oversight Committee about how as a 17-year-old she was “raped, became pregnant, and chose to have an abortion,” saying that while deciding to have an abortion was “the hardest decision I had ever made,” she “knew it was the right decision for me.” Bush testified she did not know how she could support a child on her own at the time, and said when she underwent mandatory counseling before the procedure, unlike the white women who were there at the same time as her, she was “talked to like I was trash and it worsened my shame.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) testified she underwent an abortion after being impregnated by her now-husband when she already had a son, who was born prematurely and faced significant medical issues that led the congresswoman to suffer postpartum depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The Washington Democrat said she was told her pregnancy would likely be high risk and have similar complications, and she “simply could not imagine going through that again” even though she wanted more children. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) testified she received a “back-alley abortion in Mexico” as a teenager because abortion was not legally available at the time, noting she was one of the “lucky ones” as so many other Black women from the time were killed after attempting unsafe abortions. “Today, I am testifying before you because I want you to know that there are so many different situations that people face in making these choices,” Jayapal testified. “Whether the choice to have an abortion is easy or hard, whether there are traumatic situations or not, none of that should be the issue—it is simply nobody’s business what choices we as pregnant people make about our own bodies.” In contrast to the Democratic lawmakers, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) testified how her mother was counseled to have an abortion when she was pregnant with Cammack after suffering a stroke, but instead “chose life” and had the baby. “Knowing that you were never supposed to survive, it gives you a different perspective on life,” Cammack testified, saying she was grateful her mother had the “resources” to choose not to get an abortion. The House has already passed the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify the right to an abortion in federal law and fight against other state-level restrictions on the procedure. The legislation faces long odds in the Senate, however, where it is near-certain the bill will not get the necessary 60 votes for it to pass. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has also said she will not back the bill and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) has opposed abortion in the past, making it possible the legislation would not even garner a simple majority should Democrats abolish the filibuster in order to lower the vote threshold needed. Collins has suggested she may try to introduce other legislation that would more narrowly protect federal abortion rights, however, and House Democrats are also pushing for other federal measures like the EACH Act. That legislation would reverse the Hyde Amendment and allow government-funded insurance to pay for abortion procedures. The House Oversight Committee held a hearing about state abortion restrictions after Texas law Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) went into effect September 1. That law bans all surgical abortions after approximately six weeks and marks the most extreme restrictions on the procedure to take effect in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade in 1973. Unlike other state abortion bans, SB 8 has so far avoided being struck down in court because of a unique provision that gives private citizens the power to enforce the law through lawsuits, which other states are already starting to copy. Federal abortion rights are also under threat at the U.S. Supreme Court, as the conservative-leaning court is set to hear a challenge in December to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. Their ruling could potentially significantly weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the federal right to an abortion, which could lead more than 20 states to ban the procedure.

2021-09-30	15:11:19+00:00	John Bowden	Independent	Cori Bush says Black women have ‘nothing to be ashamed of’ in testimony about racism at abortion clinic	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cori-bush-abortion-testimony-racism-b1930033.html	Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Rep Cori Bush delivered a heartbreaking account of her rape as a teenager and subsequent decision to have an abortion after being discriminated against by staff at the clinic that provided the service, at Thursday’s hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. During her testimony, Ms Bush described how she and other Black women were treated differently by clinic staff who told them that any children that they had would face poverty and made offhanded comments about how they were allegedly ruining their lives while making comments in the complete opposite vein to white women. “I overheard the clinic staff saying she had ruined her life, and that’s what they do...they being black girls,” Ms Bush said, referring to comments she heard about another Black patient. The Missouri Democrat also offered support for other young women who found themselves in her situation, declaring: “To all the black girls who have abortions and will have abortions: you have nothing to be ashamed of.” To all the Black women and girls who have had or will have abortions — know this: We have nothing to be ashamed of. We live in a society that has failed to legislate love and justice for us. But we deserve better. We demand better. We are worthy of better. pic.twitter.com/lZkpucCQ9v The hearing on Thursday comes as progressives in the House are hoping to stir action in the Senate in support of codifying abortion rights into law. Earlier this month, a law in the state of Texas took effect, despite attempts to stop it at the Supreme Court, banning abortions after six weeks into a woman’s pregnancy. The Court’s new conservative majority, which is also set to take up a direct challenge to Roe v Wade later this year, is now seen by abortion rights activists as being on the verge of significantly rolling back rights for millions of American women. As a result, many progressives including Ms Bush have endorsed sweeping changes to the Supreme Court, including “court packing”, or expanding the bench past the current total of nine justices. The tactic is not supported by President Joe Biden, but the administration relented to pressure and established a commission to investigate reforms to the Court earlier in 2021. Ms Bush had not spoken publicly about her rape before Wednesday, when Vanity Fair published an interview with her in which she divulged the experience while explaining her passionate support for abortion rights. The attack occurred while she attended a church camp; the alleged perpetrator was described by Ms Bush as being in his early 20s. On Thursday, she described how she never heard from him again even after she learned she was pregnant and reached out through mutual acquaintances. In the article published on Wednesday she also discussed brutal harassment from anti-abortion picketers outside of the women’s clinic where she received the procedure. “I remember thinking…You’re yelling at me, but you don’t know my story. You’re not going to help me with this baby if I had the baby. I felt like there was no mercy, coming from people that didn’t even know me,” the now-congresswoman said.

2021-09-30	14:10:50+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	alternet	Ending abortion rights and voting rights are part of the right's long-term plan	https://www.alternet.org/2021/09/abortion-rights-voting-rights/	"Decades of strategizing by anti-abortion forces and a relentless conservative focus on winning the courts culminated this month in the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to allow the nation's most restrictive rollback of reproductive rights to go into effect. The decision effectively prohibits most abortions in Texas and provides a road map for red state legislatures nationwide to evade judicial review and undo Roe v. Wade in their states as well. But that wasn't the only careful right-wing project that contributed to this back-door assault on five decades of constitutional protections and Supreme Court precedent. This decision is inextricably bound to the long-term GOP war on voting rights, itself a two-front effort between red state legislatures and a conservative Supreme Court majority. You might even call it a Texas two-step. First, unelected, tenured judges did what elected Republicans didn't feel empowered to do in 2006 and put a stake into the Voting Rights Act. Then, after blessing a new generation of sophisticated voter suppression methods, as well as providing a green light for partisan and racial gerrymanders, uninhibited lawmakers — untethered from nearly any accountability — can pass laws dramatically out of step with voters, like the new Texas abortion bill. This court then smiles on those efforts as well. (And of course, all this is amplified and encouraged by the right-wing media ecosystem.) It's a nifty closed loop that has the added benefit of sheltering Republicans from any consequences for their extremism, and from any real fear that a changing electorate will threaten entrenched one-party rule. This isn't even the first time that the Supreme Court and Texas legislature have danced in this fashion, though nearly a decade ago, it was the Roberts court that led. When Chief Justice John Roberts authored a 5-4 decision in the 2013 Shelby County case, hobbling the Voting Rights Act and putting an end to pre-clearance in states, like Texas, that had a longstanding history of racially motivated voting chicanery, Texas did not wait long before showing America that, contrary to Roberts' sense that things were ""dramatically"" different in the South, in reality little had changed. That very afternoon, Texas jumped to take advantage of Roberts' decision by enacting a deeply restrictive voter ID law that requires specific forms of identification to vote. This would be the first post-Shelby voting restriction in Texas, but hardly the last. The new law demanded an ID that 600,000 Latino citizens lacked; it allowed a ballot to be cast with a gun license but not a student ID. It enabled Republicans to place barriers before the rising electorate of young and Hispanic voters who lean Democratic and help ensure themselves a hold on power. It was a magnificent two-step. When a Republican Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, nearly unanimously, and the 25-year extension was signed into law by President George W. Bush, GOP leaders whipped the votes for passage, fearing that it would be bad for the Republican brand to be seen as hostile to voting rights. It's a story that Jesse Rhodes tells brilliantly in his book ""Ballot Blocked."" GOP leaders wanted to make inroads with Latino and Black voters, and worried that Hurricane Katrina and the souring economy and Iraq war might make that a challenge during a tough midterm year. They didn't want to also be seen as keeping minorities from the polls. So the voting rights putsch was outsourced to the courts. Bush appointed, and the GOP Senate confirmed, two Supreme Court justices known to have a very limited view of the Voting Rights Act's scope and relevancy: Roberts as chief justice and Samuel Alito to replace the retiring Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts, as a young Justice Department official in the Reagan administration, had lobbied aggressively against the 1982 reauthorization of the VRA. When the court did the GOP's dirty work, hollowing out the pre-clearance mechanism that Republicans viewed as untenable to take on through the political process, the Roberts decision offered Congress the option to revisit and update the pre-clearance formula. But once the courts had dealt its blow, the Republican majority had no appetite to revisit the VRA and those efforts crashed in Congress. That's the case to this day: When the Democratic House voted on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act earlier this summer, every House Republican opposed the bill, and it would appear to have little chance of surviving a GOP filibuster in the Senate. Texas Republicans may well have seen the Shelby County decision coming when they passed a draconian voter ID bill — initially blocked under pre-clearance in 2012 — ahead of the court's ruling. During that same period, Republican lawmakers also prepped new state legislative and congressional maps that were the subject of much complicated litigation from 2011 through 2018. The legal history here becomes convoluted: Courts originally blocked the first maps enacted by Republicans in 2011. A federal court rejected them under pre-clearance, finding that these lines made it tougher for minority voters to elect a candidate of their choosing. As the 2012 elections neared, a three-judge panel ordered tweaks to the legislative maps — but these were supposed to be temporary fixes while the legal challenges worked their way through the courts. But when the Shelby decision came down, as the Texas Tribune observed, Texas suddenly no longer needed to pre-clear its maps. Republican leaders disingenuously cloaked themselves in a map they could claim was drawn by the courts, when really those judges had only approved the first step in a much longer process. How could we be diluting minority voters, the state protested, when we just took the courts' map? Lower federal courts disagreed, and developed a rich evidence file that delved deep into the 2011 mapmaking process and referred to the 2013 GOP strategy as ""discriminatory at its heart."" Once again, however, the Supreme Court stepped in. In 2018's Abbott v. Perez, the Supreme Court overturned those lower court decisions that found Republicans had diluted minority votes in multiple state house districts. They OK'd what had been called a racial gerrymander of the state legislature which judges said went ""out of its way"" to preserve GOP power at the expense of Latino voting power, with ""serious costs to our democracy."" That 5-4 decision, written by Justice Alito, insisted that when it comes to redistricting, the good faith of the legislature must be assumed. Alito blithely dismissed a 150-page lower court report that laid out, county by county, the precise machinations that Republican mapmakers used to crack and pack growing numbers of Latino voters, and even a careful study of which Latino voters were most likely to turn out. (Those unlikely to vote could also be carefully distributed in order to make districts appear to resemble a ""minority opportunity"" district, without actually being one.) In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of ignoring ""undeniable proof of intentional discrimination,"" contributing to the deliberate underrepresentation of minority voters and doing ""great damage"" to both equal opportunity and equal participation in the political process. The majority decision, she wrote, ""blinds itself to the overwhelming factual record"" in order to ""allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters."" Texas isn't a red state or a blue state. It's a voter suppression state, with some of the lowest turnout numbers in the country, in part because the state — with the full support of the U.S. Supreme Court, since the 2013 Shelby County case — makes it so difficult to vote. By 2014, Texas turnout had plunged to the lowest in the nation, just 28.3 percent according to the Elections Project. A sexy 2018 U.S. Senate race between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke helped push that number higher, but the Elections Project still found Texas mired among the lowest 10 states in the nation. Political scientists will long debate the impact of redistricting, voter ID laws and other restrictive techniques, as well as the Roberts court's rulings on the VRA and gerrymandering, on the democratic backsliding that has become a feature of so many red state legislatures and contributed to the growing crisis of GOP minority rule. But no one needs an advanced degree to see the effects of this two-step on extreme legislation on reproductive rights, among other issues, coming from Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere — despite zero indication that voters in these states desire these new restrictions or have moved anywhere near as far right on these issues as their representatives. Perhaps the problem is that this Supreme Court has made it exceptionally difficult for voters to get rid of their representatives when they go too far, and that this has emboldened lawmakers who no longer fear that their extremism might lead either to defeat or reproach from the courts. Indeed, this Supreme Court, under Alito's lead, has encouraged legislatures to go a step further. After the ruling on the Texas law, in which justices threw up their hands at the novel workaround created by empowering citizens to turn in anyone involved in making an abortion possible, the signal to every other state was this: Go as far as you want. This court has your back. The message to the rest of the nation is clear as well. When voting rights are hollowed out, it opens the door to an assault on every right you hold dear and any policy that matters to you, whether that's reproductive rights, labor rights, gun control, the environment, or whether or not your kids can be asked to wear masks at school during a pandemic. If voters want to change those policies, Samuel Alito says tough. He can't be voted out of office — and his colleagues just keep tilting the rules so your legislators can't be either. As redistricting begins in state legislatures nationwide, Republican state legislators are building up their own walls of protection. If Democrats want to reverse course before a potential generation of GOP minority rule, 2022 could be the last chance. Congress must protect voting rights. And we all must prioritize state legislative and secretary of state races. We invest now to win next November — or the Texas two-step could be playing in your state next."
2021-09-30	13:38:35+00:00	Elizabeth Nolan Brown	reason	Abortion Ban Stimulates Interstate Travel, Says Texas	https://reason.com/2021/09/30/abortion-ban-stimulates-interstate-travel-says-texas/	" Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 9.30.2021 9:38 AM The federal government can't sue over a near-total ban on abortion in Texas because it ""is stimulating rather than obstructing interstate travel,"" the state argues. In a motion to dismiss the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit against it, Texas suggests that legal precedent cited by the DOJ only lets the government sue when ""interstate commerce was obstructed by a denial of civil rights."" ""One of the precedents that applies here is a case where the US was able to get an injunction against striking workers, partly because it was impacting interstate commerce,"" explains Jacqueline Thomsen of the National Law Journal on Twitter. ""Texas argues this doesn't involve the same issue so the precedent doesn't work."" ""In this case, the federal government does not bring a commerce claim, nor does it cite any actual evidence that the Texas Heartbeat Act burdens interstate commerce,"" states the Texas motion, filed September 29. ""What evidence that does exist in the record suggests that, if anything, the Act is stimulating rather than obstructing interstate travel,"" it says, noting an ""increase in Texas women traveling to Oklahoma"" to terminate their pregnancies. So, the state admits that its ""pro-life"" law isn't actually stopping Texas women from getting abortions, just driving them across state lines—that is, not ""saving babies,"" as supporters claim, but simply making women getting abortions jump through hoops. Texas also argues that the federal government hasn't specified a cause of action, lacks jurisdiction, and ""has not clearly shown that the Texas Heartbeat Act is unconstitutional."" It says that for the law to be challenged, it must be done by private citizens in state court. You can read the state's full argument here. The Volokh Conspiracy has a multi-part series analyzing constitutional challenges to the Texas law (Senate Bill 8), which also lets abortion doctors and anyone who ""aids and abets"" an abortion be sued. It has already spawned a couple of lawsuits. See: ""We have an agreement on the C.R.—the continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown—and we should be voting on that tomorrow morning,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) yesterday. The Senate ""can approve this measure quickly, and send it to the House so it can reach the President's desk before funding expires midnight tomorrow."" Government shutdown starts today if Congress can't get it together enough to vote against it. For that to happen, it looks like everyone will have to agree to Republicans' preferred version of a stopgap funding bill. From CNN: The effort to prevent a shutdown has in recent days been caught up in a fight over how to address a looming debt limit crisis. Democrats initially attempted to pair the two fiscal issues -- the debt limit and government funding -- and pass legislation that would resolve both, but that ran aground in the Senate due to GOP opposition. Republicans have said they would support a ""clean"" stopgap funding bill that does not include a debt limit provision, arguing that Democrats must address the debt limit on their own without GOP votes. Democrats have pushed back, saying that addressing the debt limit is a shared bipartisan responsibility. In the face of GOP opposition to combining the two issues, Congress now appears poised to pass a ""clean"" funding bill without the debt limit attached. Schumer said Wednesday that once they fund the government, Congress still needs to ""address the urgent matter of extending the debt ceiling."" Demographic diversity in rural America. It's on the rise, according to the latest U.S. census. ""The future of rural America is increasingly marked by growing diversity and expanding inequity within and across regions—creating an intricate picture that binary thinking can't capture,"" Brookings Institution researchers write. They note that rural parts of the country have gotten more racially and ethnically diverse, and that ""the distribution of people of color in rural America is complex and highly regionalized"": Contrary to the dominant narratives that use ""rural"" as a synonym for ""white,"" 24% of rural Americans were people of color in 2020. While rural America is still less diverse than the nation as a whole (42.2% people of color), it is diversifying as well: The median rural county saw its population of color increase by 3.5 percentage points between 2010 and 2020…. The makeup of rural populations of color is shaped by highly regionalized variations in the concentration of Black Americans, Latino Americans, and Indigenous Americans across the nation. As Figure 2 demonstrates, rural counties in the South and West are particularly racially and ethnically diverse—with a substantial number of rural areas in these regions majority or near-majority people of color.

2021-09-30	12:26:47+00:00	Unknown	upi	Justice Department to argue against Texas abortion law	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/09/30/Justice-Department-Texas-abortion-law/5921633003481/	"Sept. 30 (UPI) -- Texas' near-total ban on abortions became law Sept. 1 and quickly became the target of several lawsuits aiming to stop its enforcement. But as those legal battles continue -- with one case the subject of a federal court hearing Friday -- Senate Bill 8 still stands. Abortion providers, doctors, women's rights groups and even the U.S. government are battling to overturn the law, which bans the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy -- before many know they're pregnant. The nation's highest court has taken up the law once -- though it didn't weigh in on its constitutionality -- and multiple lawsuits are pending. A federal lawsuit filed by the Biden administration will hold a hearing Friday in a U.S. District Court. Abortion remains a constitutional right under Supreme Court precedent. But the structure of SB 8 allows it to skirt precedent by offloading the enforcement of the statute from government and law officials to private citizens. By empowering anyone in the nation to file lawsuits against a provider or person who aids someone in getting an abortion and barring state enforcement, SB 8 makes it difficult to name the right defendants in the lawsuits that would block enforcement of the law. In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court decided to not block the law on the day it went into effect. The court cited procedural difficulties and tossed that legal case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it currently sits. But justices stressed that the court was not ruling on the statute's constitutionality, namely not overruling Roe vs. Wade. Here are where the various challenges to the law stand. U.S. vs. Texas The Department of Justice sued Texas on Sept. 9 in an attempt to block the law's enforcement after the Biden administration vowed to take action. Federal and state attorneys will present arguments on Friday. The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Robert L. Pitman, a 2014 nominee of former President Barack Obama, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Justice Department says the law was deliberately constructed to flout constitutional rights by making it difficult to challenge in court. ""It is settled constitutional law that 'a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability,'"" U.S. attorneys stated in the lawsuit. ""But Texas has done just that."" But the state responded that just because the law is difficult to challenge judicially doesn't mean it should be overturned. ""If the Department of Justice wants to expand its authority, it should direct its requests to Congress, not this court,"" Texas' filing states. Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, says that while the federal lawsuit has distinct differences from other legal challenges to the abortion law, it's unlikely to block the near-total ban. The Justice Department can sue states without regard to sovereign immunity, which grants protections for state agencies against lawsuits. A separate lawsuit filed by abortion providers named a judge as a defendant, which can draw questions of sovereign immunity. The Justice Department's lawsuit claims the state law interferes with the federal government's ability to carry out its duties in some circumstances. Blackman said it would be an uphill climb to demonstrate that in court and even if it did, it wouldn't likely justify blocking the entire law. Still, Blackman said Pitman likely would rule in favor of the Justice Department. But Pitman's ruling would likely not be the final word on the matter. The state would likely appeal and send the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a suit filed by abortion providers case currently sits. The 5th Circuit is arguably the nation's most conservative appeals court. At that point, the Supreme Court could also be asked to step in on this suit, but Blackman said he believes the justices will make a similar ruling to the one it made earlier and not decide the law's constitutionality. Legal experts have varied forecasts for how the case will play out -- if they'll make a prediction at all. Because Blackman doesn't think the Supreme Court will eventually deem the law unconstitutional, he thinks it is here to stay. ""This law is not killable,"" he said. ""It's like a hydra, you can't kill it -- you chop off one head and two heads grow in its place."" However, Javier Oliva, a practicing law professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said he believes the law will be overturned as a result of the Justice Department lawsuit. He thinks the law could be proven to put an undue burden on women who cannot get timely treatment or those who have to travel across state lines -- and he thinks those arguments could be used to block the law's enforcement until its constitutionality is decided. John Seago, legislative director for the prominent anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, which helped draft SB 8, has called the Justice Department lawsuit ""the most credible threat at this point"" to the abortion law. ​Lauren Stiller Rikleen, a board member of Lawyers Defending American Democracy, said the Supreme Court's decision to not block the law temporarily while the courts considered its constitutionality shocked her and other law experts. Now, she's unsure what to expect. ""No one would have thought that the Supreme Court would have allowed this law to stand while all these appeals were being undertaken,"" she said. ""I think you have to give up predicting on the statute after the Supreme Court's ruling on Sept. 1."" At least two lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Alan Braid, a San Antonio OB/GYN who admitted in a Washington Post column that he performed an abortion illegal under the state's new statute. The lawsuits could test the law in state courts. If appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, the justices could determine the law's constitutionality or even block people from filing lawsuits who can't demonstrate how they are injured by someone else getting an abortion. But many are dubious of how the all-Republican court would rule if a case were brought to them. It's also unclear if the individual lawsuits filed will ever be heard. Some legal experts speculate that because the two plaintiffs -- both out-of-state, disbarred attorneys -- cite testing the law or wanting to overturn it as reasons for the suits, they could be thrown out altogether. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents Braid, did not comment on the lawsuits. Blackman said cases brought on by private citizens could also potentially make their way to the Texas Supreme Court -- which so far has not been tapped to weigh in on the law. Texas' high court could then potentially rule that the plaintiffs empowered by SB 8 to file lawsuits are not actually injured and therefore that the lawsuits should be dismissed -- or the court could block enforcement of the law altogether, he said. Abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman's Health Alliance, filed a lawsuit on July 13 aiming to block the abortion restrictions after Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law. Pitman is also overseeing this case. But proceedings were halted after defendants appealed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals -- leading to a scheduled hearing being canceled just before the law came into effect. The lawsuit sits with the 5th Circuit, which has not ended its stay. The appeals court will not hold arguments earlier than December, according to court filings from abortion providers. The providers asked the Supreme Court to take over the case and fast-track proceedings in a rarely used procedure called ""certiorari before judgment."" But Blackman says it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant this request. He said the case likely will continue to be handled by the 5th Circuit, at least for now. The U.S. House last week passed a reproductive rights bill that would nullify Texas' controversial near-total abortion ban by codifying the right to an abortion into federal law. The legislation is unlikely to pass in the Senate, and therefore, unlikely to become law. U.S. Supreme Court to hear Mississippi case Many eyes are on another abortion-related case in front of the Supreme Court, which is set to hear arguments on Dec. 1. A new law in Mississippi aiming to ban most abortions after 15 weeks was temporarily blocked by a district court in 2018, which the 5th Circuit upheld the following year. Through this case, justices could overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. If the precedent is overturned, 11 states, including Texas and Mississippi, have ""trigger laws"" that would automatically go into effect to ban abortions in their communities.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) found himself at the center of controversy as a result of his latest tweet in support of individuals making their own choice with their bodies. On Wednesday, September 29th, the Republican lawmaker verbalized his support for NBA star Kyrie Young. “I stand with Kyrie Irving and a number of other stars who oppose the COVID-19 vaccine and are refusing to share whether or not they will ever get their vaccine. I stand with Andrew Wiggins. I stand with Bradley Beal. I stand with Jonathan Isaac. #YourBodyYourChoice."" Twitter users quickly noticed the hypocrisy in his words. According to The Independent, droves of lawmakers, celebrities, and other public figures hit back at Cruz. Per the publication, those individuals included: ""Comedy host Samantha Bee, music producer Thelonious Martin, former footballer Shannon Sharpe, and numerous other Twitter users joined the attack, as did Democratic activists such as Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine Pelosi and social media influencer Majid Padellan, known as Brooklyn Dad Defiant."" Film director and comedian Judd Apatow also fired back at Cruz tweeting, “So you believe in choice now? Are you going to fight for that? Oh, not for women. Got it."" Former football player and current broadcaster George Wrighster III also offered Cruz a piece of advice. “Keep this same #YourBodyYourChoice energy when it comes to women's bodies."""

The Chinese government announced this week that the number of ""non-medical"" abortions is to be reduced over the next decade. It has not defined what it means by ""non-medical"". Nor has it provided any details as to how the reduction will be achieved. Generations of Chinese lived within the restraints of the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to halt a rising birth rate at the time. It was replaced in 2015 with a two-child policy which was this year raised to allow three children per family. The relaxation of the rules has been accompanied by cash incentives to have children. But the policy changes over the last six years have failed to halt the decline. In 2016, there were 18 million recorded births, falling to 12 million in 2020. The new strategy forms part of the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to reverse this decline. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) has given the announcement a cautious welcome but said it wants to see a more pro-life China emerge. ""While the reduction of abortion is to be welcomed, of course, one has to question the Chinese State Council's underlying motives â more concerned, it seems, with population growth than it is with the inherent right to life of unborn children,"" a spokesperson said. ""As SPUC has highlighted before, a state should never have the right to tell parents how many children they may have.

The new law, which bans abortions after about six weeks and empowers private citizens to enforce it https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-abortion-ban-opens-up-wild-west-enforcement-critics-say-2021-09-02, has the clinics “teeter-tottering between financial risk, legal risk and staffing risk,” said Marva Sadler, the facilities’ director of clinical services. As the law is debated in courts – with a key hearing slated for Friday – abortion rights advocates say its impact has been swift and wide-ranging since it took effect on Sept. 1. Abortion clinics are struggling to survive: The number of patients getting abortions at Whole Woman’s Health clinics dropped 70%, Sadler said. Women are seeking other options, including traveling to out-of-state clinics or obtaining abortion-inducing pills via mail. Abortion rights advocates warn Texas will be a blueprint for other Republican-led states if its law is upheld. They consider it a major blow to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 decision that established the right to abortion access, which will itself be tested https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-courts-rightward-lurch-put-roe-v-wade-brink-2021-09-03 by a Mississippi case the court will hear in December. “Lawmakers from across the country were watching the Texas bill very closely… and when the Supreme Court allowed https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/texas-six-week-abortion-ban-takes-effect-2021-09-01 this unconstitutional ban to go into effect, they said, ‘now’s our chance,'” said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and policy organization. Texas’ so-called “heartbeat” law bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo, usually around six weeks. That’s before most women know they are pregnant and before 85% to 90% of all abortions are carried out, experts say. The law makes no exception for cases of rape and incest. It lets citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Some of Texas’ so-called “crisis pregnancy centers,” Christian-based facilities that encourage women to not have abortions, have seen a rise in visits since the law took effect, with more women seeking ultrasounds earlier in their pregnancies. The Raffa pregnancy clinic in Greenville had a 166% increase in ultrasounds in the first three weeks of September compared to the same period last year, said the facility’s executive director Threesa Sadler, who supports the law. Two clients whose scans revealed a fetal heartbeat were women she thinks might have terminated their pregnancies had that still been an option, she said. “Beyond helping decrease abortion in Texas, I don’t know if it was an intended consequence that the law would also push more women to (crisis) pregnancy centers, but I love that that’s what’s happening,” she said. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department will ask a federal judge in Austin to temporarily block the law while its constitutionality is challenged. Under Roe v. Wade, states cannot ban abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb, which doctors generally view as between 24 and 28 weeks. Abortion rights advocates worry the law will have lasting damage even if eventually overturned. “We know that when these laws are passed, part of the strategy is to close clinics while these bills sit in the courts awaiting decisions,” said Nikki Madsen, executive director of Abortion Care Network, a national association that includes seven independent abortion clinics in Texas. Madsen said 23 of Texas’ 42 surgical abortion clinics closed after the state passed a law in 2013 requiring clinic physicians to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that law in 2016, but today there are still only 19 clinics offering surgical abortions in Texas. Hundreds of women now are seeking abortions outside Texas, lengthening wait times in nearby states such as Oklahoma and Louisiana, according to evidence the Justice Department cited in its lawsuit. In court documents, an Oklahoma-based Planned Parenthood doctor said Texas patients had traveled long distances to get treatment at his clinic since Sept. 1. One woman drove six hours alone, one way, because she feared any companion could get in trouble under the law. Others are procuring abortion-inducing medication by mail. KT Volkova, a graduate student in central Texas who uses the pronoun “they,” discovered they were pregnant a few days before the law’s effective date. No appointments for surgical abortions near Volkova were available before Sept. 1, and Volkova was already nearly six weeks pregnant. Volkova, who volunteers with a group that provides financial assistance to abortion seekers, opted against seeking funds to travel out of state for the procedure and instead took an abortion-inducing medication that came by mail. “I would have preferred to have it in-clinic, with staff holding my hand, but I had to go through the entire process in my apartment alone,” Volkova said. Access to abortion-inducing medication will soon be further restricted in Texas. A state law taking effect on Dec. 2 will narrow the window for medical abortions from 10 weeks to seven weeks after conception. Providing women with abortion-inducing drugs by mail will be a criminal offense under the law. We tried it ... Toronto-headquartered jewelry company to open Kitsilano store on Dec. 9.

2021-09-30	09:40:30+00:00	Destiny Lopez09.30.2021	Truth Beauty Science. - Undark	At the FDA, a Key Opportunity to Advance Abortion Justice	https://undark.org/2021/09/30/at-the-fda-a-key-opportunity-to-advance-abortion-justice/	 Perhaps more now than in any other time in recent memory, Americans’ right to abortion care seems to be hanging by a thread. On Sept. 1, a Texas law went into effect that barred nearly all abortion care in the state. The U.S. Supreme Court, more anti-abortion than it has been in decades, will soon consider a case that could completely dismantle our federal right to abortion care. But in one branch of the federal government, officials are weighing a decision that could actually expand access to abortion care: The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to lift 21-year-old restrictions that limit access to medication abortion. Medication abortion care is widely considered a safe way to end an early pregnancy. It involves taking two medications and is considered safe and effective for ending pregnancies up to 10 weeks. Nearly 40 percent of abortions are now done using medication abortion, according to recent data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy nonprofit advocating for sexual and reproductive health and rights. Yet outdated FDA restrictions, coupled with state restrictions, have created enormous and unnecessary barriers to care. Specifically, under federal rules, medication abortion is not available at pharmacies, nor is it always deliverable through mail; it’s only offered by providers or clinics who are specially certified to stock, prescribe, and dispense it from their office. The restrictions keep many providers from dispensing medication for abortion at all. State restrictions go even further: 19 states bar people from using telehealth for medication abortion. And, while medical experts agree that medication abortion can be safely provided by advanced practice nurses and physician’s assistants, 32 states mandate that it be provided by a doctor. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, advocates have been pushing the FDA to lift in-person dispensing requirements, resulting in a federal ruling in July 2020 that allowed patients to virtually speak to a doctor and have medication mailed to them. Following a Supreme Court ruling that halted the practice in January, the FDA temporarily lifted the in-person dispensing requirement in April. In May, the FDA announced it was reviewing its restrictions, with advocates hoping officials will make the new rule change permanent. If the agency does decide to lift the in-person dispensing restriction, it would hold incredible promise to remove some of the barriers to care. According to the Guttmacher Institute, medication abortion provided by telehealth could reduce the distance someone would have to travel to get care, especially in rural communities. People who choose medication abortion wouldn’t have to sacrifice wages or give up limited financial resources to pay for gas, child care, and related expenses. If the FDA permanently lifts these restrictions, it will be a significant step forward — at least for people fortunate enough to live in states that protect the right to abortion care. But expanded access to medication abortion cannot be at the expense of other abortion care, nor can it leave behind those who are continually marginalized by our health systems. To achieve true abortion justice, we must create policy that meets the following four conditions. First, it must be equitable — its benefits must extend to Black, Brown, Indigenous, and other people of color, and those working to make ends meet. For complex reasons due to systemic racism and economic inequality, women of color are more likely to have an abortion and are therefore more likely to bear the brunt of abortion restrictions, including restrictions on medication abortion. As an example of the impact on Indigenous communities, one tribal hospital in Arizona has been working for two years to cut through the red tape to stock medication for abortion at health facilities located on federal reservation land. New regulations on medication abortion should be tailored to expand access to these communities. Second, medication abortion, and all forms of abortion care, must be made more affordable. Medication abortion in the U.S. costs, on average, around $500. But the federal Hyde Amendment prohibits people enrolled in Medicaid from using their health insurance to cover abortion, including medication abortion. Since it was initially passed in 1976, the Hyde Amendment has been expanded to deny coverage for many other groups of people, including federal employees and their dependents, military personnel and their dependents, people in federal prisons and immigrant detention centers, Native Americans, and Peace Corps volunteers. Policymakers must break down these and other financial barriers to care. Expanded access to medication abortion cannot be at the expense of other abortion care, nor can it leave behind those who are continually marginalized by our health systems. Third, ensuring access for all depends on addressing America’s digital divide. Most Americans express support for telehealth, which became widespread during the Covid-19 pandemic, and a majority of people who have used telehealth want to keep using it beyond the current crisis. Yet people of color and those struggling financially have less access to high-speed internet at home than their White, wealthier peers. What’s more, people with limited English proficiency face deep gaps in digital literacy. If we tackle these issues, telehealth-provided medication abortion could make it easier for someone seeking abortion to connect with a culturally competent provider, including one fluent in their primary language. It might also boost access to abortion for undocumented immigrants who fear being detained by immigration enforcement if they seek in-person care. Finally, medication abortion cannot be seen as a one-size-fits-all solution, advanced at the expense of in-clinic procedures. It must be understood as one among many options for care, because we all should have the ability to decide what type of care is right for us, and because not everyone can get an abortion before 10 weeks. Patients may need to use one option of care over others for different reasons. Travel, cost, and time constraints may lead one person to seek medication abortion. Someone else may be more comfortable controlling their experience at home but want to pick up their medication in person. Someone experiencing intimate partner violence may have very specific needs related to the time and place of their abortion, which may be crucial for their safety. For as many reasons as there are people, all points of access to abortion care must be available and equitable. Medication abortion has the potential to dramatically reshape the provision of abortion care, particularly if onerous federal dispensing regulations and state restrictions on telehealth are removed. These actions would begin to clear a path for people of color and rural communities to get care on their own terms. But they are not the only steps we should take. For policymakers to advance true abortion justice, they must protect the availability of all abortion care, ensure it is affordable, and ensure it can reach communities of color and those working to make ends meet without unnecessary barriers, stigma, or shame. They must make racial and economic justice a central part of this transformation. If we meet these core conditions, we can move toward a future with true abortion justice — a future that doesn’t leave anyone behind. Destiny Lopez is the co-president of All* Above All, which unites individuals across the country and over 130 organizations to build a future where abortion is affordable, available, and supported for anyone who seeks care.
2021-09-30	09:00:07+00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wilson-jason	The Guardian	Top Republicans rub shoulders with extremists in secretive rightwing group, leak reveals	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/30/revealed-council-national-policy-republicans-extremists	First published on Thu 30 Sep 2021 05.00 EDT A leaked document has revealed the membership list of the secretive Council for National Policy (CNP), showing how it provides opportunities for elite Republicans, wealthy entrepreneurs, media proprietors and pillars of the US conservative movement to rub shoulders with anti-abortion and anti-Islamic extremists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors rightwing hate groups, describes the CNP as “a shadowy and intensely secretive group [which] has operated behind the scenes” in its efforts to “build the conservative movement”. The leaked membership list dates from September last year, and reveals the 40-year-old CNP put influential Trump administration figures alongside leaders of organizations that have been categorized as hate groups. The group was founded in 1981 by activists influential in the Christian right, including Tim LaHaye, Howard Phillips and Paul Weyrich, who had also been involved in founding and leading the Moral Majority. Initially they were seeking to maximize their influence on the new Reagan administration. In subsequent years, CNP meetings have played host to presidential aspirants like George W Bush in 1999 and Mitt Romney in 2007, and sitting presidents including Donald Trump in 2020. In videos obtained by the Washington Post in 2020, the CNP executive committee chairman, Bill Walton, told attendees of the upcoming election: “This is a spiritual battle we are in. This is good versus evil.” The CNP is so secretive, according to reports, that its members are instructed not to reveal their affiliation or even name the group. Heidi Beirich, of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said in an email that “this new CNP list makes clear that the group still serves as a key venue where mainstream conservatives and extremists mix”, adding that CNP “clearly remains a critical nexus for mainstreaming extremism from the far right into conservative circles”. The document – which reveals email addresses and phone numbers for most members – shows that the CNP includes members of SPLC-listed hate groups. They include leaders of organizations listed as anti-Muslim hate groups, including: Frank Gaffney, founder and executive chairman of the Center for Security Policy (CSP) Brigitte Gabriel, founder and chairman of Act For America (AFA) They also include several founders or leaders of groups listed as anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups, such as: Michael P Farris, president and CEO of the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) Brad Dacus, founder and president of the Pacific Justice Institute Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council Matthew Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association Also, there are members of organizations listed as anti-immigrant hate groups, including James and Amapola Hansberger, co-founders of Legal Immigrants For America (Lifa). Additionally, the list includes members of groups that have been accused of extremist positions on abortion. They include Margaret H Hartshorn, chair of the board of Heartbeat International, which has reportedly spread misinformation worldwide to pregnant women. Several high-profile figures associated with the Trump administration, or conspiracy-minded characters in Trump’s orbit, are also on the list, such as Jerome R Corsi, who has written conspiracy-minded books about John Kerry, Barack Obama and the September 11 attacks. Corsi is listed as a member of CNP’s board of governors. Along with these representatives of extremist positions, the CNP rolls include members of ostensibly more mainstream conservative groups, and representatives of major American corporations. Still others come from the Republican party, a network of rightwing activist organizations, and the companies and foundations that back them. A newcomer to the group since a previous version of the member list was exposed is Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative youth organization. Although TPUSA works hard to make inroads into mainstream culture with stunts and on-campus events, Kirk has recently staked out more hard-right positions, saying last week that Democratic immigration policies were aimed at “diminishing and decreasing white demographics in America”, a day after Tucker Carlson ventilated racist “great replacement” conspiracy theories on his Fox News program. Conservative movement heavyweights in the group include Lisa B Nelson, chief executive of the American Legislative Exchange Council; Eugene Mayer, president of the Federalist Society; Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform; Daniel Schneider, executive director of the American Conservative Union, which organizes the CPac conference; and L Brent Bozell III, the founder of the Media Research Center and a member of the Bozell and Buckley dynasties of conservative activists. Other members include pillars of the Republican political establishment, including former GOP congressional majority leader Tom DeLay; former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker; Reagan administration attorney general Edwin Meese III; and former RNC chair and Trump White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Their number also includes sitting congressmen such as Barry Loudermilk and influential operatives like David Trulio, who was the senior adviser and chief of staff to the under-secretary of defense in the Trump administration. The member list also includes representatives of major US corporations, such as Marc Johansen, vice-president for the satellites and intelligence program for Boeing; Jeffrey Coors, of the Coors brewing family, who have extensively sponsored conservative groups; Lee Roy Mitchell, the founder and chairman of the board for movie chain owner Cinemark Holdings; Steve Forbes, the founder and chief executive of the Forbes business media empire; and Scott Brown, a senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley. Other members of the group represent organizations that operate under a veil of secrecy, with conservative “dark money” organizations well represented. One member, Lawson Bader, is the president of Donor’s Trust and Donors Capital Fund, nonprofits that disguise the identities of their own donors, and whose largesse to rightwing causes has earned them the reputation as “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement”. Another member, Richard Graber, is the president and chief executive of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Bradley foundation has long bankrolled conservative movement causes, including Donors Trust, and has reportedly sponsored widespread efforts to discredit the election of Joe Biden in 2020. Conservative media figures are also on the list: Neil Patel, co-founder and publisher of the Daily Caller; Larry Beasley, chief executive of the rightwing newspaper the Washington Times; and Floyd Brown, the founder of the Arizona-based Western Journal and founder of the Citizens United Pac. Pro-gun groups are also represented, with NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and Gun Owners of America founder Tim Macy each listed as members. The 220-page document – which includes a statement of principles and an indication of members’ policy interests alongside a complete member list – was leaked and provided to journalists via a transparency organization, Distributed Denial of Secrets. An earlier, redacted version of the list was published along with reporting by the Center for Media and Democracy in late 2020. DDOSecret’s publication restored personal information, which allowed further reporting and verification of the list’s contents. Emma Best from that group said in a messenger chat that CNP was “a secretive forum for ultra-wealthy and elite conservatives to strategize and form long-term plans that have national and international impact”. Therefore, she said, “any opportunity to shine a light on their members, activities and interests is clearly in the public interest”. The Guardian repeatedly requested comment from CNP staff, including executive director Bob McEwen, and other groups mentioned in this story but received no immediate response. This article was amended on 30 September and 4 October 2021. An earlier version misnamed Americans for Tax Reform as “Americans for Tax Return”; and the executive director of the CNP is Bob McEwen, not Brad McEwen.
2021-09-30	06:01:00+00:00	Unknown	ticotimes	Thousands march for abortion rights in Latin America	https://ticotimes.net/2021/09/30/thousands-march-for-abortion-rights-in-latin-america	Thousands of women took to the streets across Latin America on Tuesday to demand abortion rights, a practice largely prohibited in the region where hundreds of women are serving prison time under draconian laws. With banners that read “Legal Abortion Now” and “Right to Decide,” and wearing green scarves that are characteristic of the global movement for decriminalizing abortion, protesters rallied in El Salvador, Chile, Peru, Mexico and Colombia. In El Salvador, where abortion is banned in all cases, women seeking the procedure can face up to eight years in prison for “aggravated homicide.” Seventeen women currently remain in detention after having experienced obstetric emergencies, women’s rights advocates say. On Tuesday — International Safe Abortion Day — hundreds of Salvadoran women demonstrated outside the national legislature, carrying a large banner that read: “To decide is my right, legal abortion now.” A committee of the protesters presented a proposal to Congress for legalizing abortion in certain cases, such as when the pregnancy puts the woman’s life at risk, if the fetus is unlikely to survive after birth, or if the pregnancy “is the result of sexual violence.” The proposal comes after El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele withdrew a constitutional reform in mid-September, drafted by his own government, that would have opened the door to legalize therapeutic — or medically necessary — abortions. Besides El Salvador, abortion is banned in Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and most other countries allow it only for medical reasons or in case of rape. In Chile, the lower house of Congress on Tuesday approved a bill to decriminalize abortion within 14 weeks of pregnancy, a major step in a country where the Catholic Church has fiercely opposed the practice. Lawmakers gave the green light with 75 votes in favor, 68 against, and two abstentions, according to the congressional Twitter account. The proposal has yet to be approved by Chile’s ultra-conservative senate. The bill, submitted in 2018 by opposition lawmakers, seeks to change the existing law, which allows elective abortion only in three scenarios: when there is a threat to the life of the pregnant woman, if the fetus is unviable, or if the pregnancy was the result of rape. These legal abortions represent only about three percent of the thousands of clandestine terminations taking place in the country, according to activists. Until 2017, Chile maintained an outright ban on the procedure still denied most women in Latin America. “This is for all the women… who have been persecuted and criminalized,” tweeted Communist lawmaker Camila Vallejo, one of the authors of the bill. “Down with the patriarchy which will fall, will fall!” she added. “Up with feminism, which will win, will win!” In Latin America, abortion is currently legal only in Uruguay, Cuba, Argentina and Guyana, as well as in Mexico City and four of Mexico’s 32 states. In Mexico City on Tuesday, dozens of women marched downtown calling for the procedure to be decriminalized across the country. One of the banners carried by the protesters read “Abortion is not legal, rape is.” Some activists shouted: “Let the sexists tremble, Latin America will be feminist!” Hundreds of police were deployed at the protest and there were altercations between them and the women. The demonstration took place after a landmark ruling by Mexico’s Supreme Court earlier this month, which declared that abortion cannot be considered a crime. The decision opened the door for all Mexican women to access this procedure without fear of being prosecuted and potentially imprisoned, but legal hurdles still remain. Another pro-choice protest was held in Lima. Dozens marched to demand that the Peruvian government legalize abortion, which is currently allowed only when the woman’s life is in danger. But the protesters face an uphill battle with the recently elected leftist leader Pedro Castillo, a social conservative who rejecting the idea during the presidential campaign. In Peru, around 370,000 clandestine abortions are performed each year, according to estimates by civil society groups. The featured photo shows a pro-abortion march in Chile in 2018.
2021-09-30	01:27:00+00:00	Unknown	boston	Pilot appeared to try to abort landing before Cape Cod crash	https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2021/09/29/pilot-appeared-to-try-to-abort-landing-before-cape-cod-crash/	WASHINGTON (AP) — The pilot of a plane that crashed on Cape Cod this month may have been trying to abort the landing in heavy rain before the plane crashed into trees beyond the runway and burst into flames, according to federal investigators. Another pilot for the same airline, Cape Air, told investigators the plane was traveling “a little faster than it should be” when it touched down, and he knew it would not be able to stop on the wet runway, the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday in a preliminary report. The second pilot saw the plane try to take off again, but it wasn’t climbing fast enough. After clearing a fence, “The airplane disappeared into the trees, and he then saw a ball of flames,” the report recounted. The pilot and six passengers on the Cape Air Cessna 402 from Boston were seriously injured but survived the Sept. 9 crash near Provincetown, Massachusetts. The pilot was not identified. The preliminary report indicates he is very experienced, with 17,617 flight hours, including 10,000 hours in Cessna 403 planes. Investigators did not give an opinion about the cause of the accident. It usually takes the NTSB a year to 18 months to write a final report and reach a decision about cause. The pilot who witnessed the crash was in another plane holding on the ground as Cape Air flight 2072 approached Provincetown Municipal Airport. He said the pilot of flight 2072 radioed to ask if the airport lights were on, and he replied that they were — and that visibility was improving as the rain eased. The NTSB said airport surveillance video appeared to show that it was raining heavily at the time, and a splash of water could be seen as the plane landed. There was also a tailwind, which would make stopping more difficult. The plane settled upright about 200 feet (60 meters) from where it first struck the trees, the NTSB said. The fire destroyed parts of both wings but all major components of the plane were recovered.
2021-09-30	00:12:01+00:00	Independent Staff	The Independent	Ted Cruz ridiculed for tweeting ‘#YourBodyYourChoice’ despite anti-abortion position	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ted-cruz-abortion-tweet-nba-b1929605.html	"Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Ted Cruz has provoked anger from celebrities and social media users by tweeting in support of anti-vaccine basketball players with a slogan normally associated with abortion rights. The Texas Republican senator used the hashtag #YourBodyYourChoice on Wednesday to back National Basketball Association (NBA) stars who reportedly refused their Covid shots, despite his state’s radical new anti-abortion laws. The hashtag is traditionally used by women’s rights activists in support of abortion, but has been increasingly co-opted by anti-vaxxers and opponents of mandatory vaccination. “I stand with Kyrie Irving. I stand with Andrew Wiggins. I stand with Bradley Beal. I stand with Jonathan Isaac. #YourBodyYourChoice,” Mr Cruz said. All have refused the vaccine or refused to say whether they will take it. Film director and comedian Judd Apatow shot back: “So you believe in choice now? Are you going to fight for that? Oh, not for women. Got it.” Former American football player turned broadcaster George Wrighster III said: “Keep this same #YourBodyYourChoice energy when it comes to women’s bodies.” Comedy host Samantha Bee, music producer Thelonious Martin, former footballer Shannon Sharpe, and numerous other Twitter users joined the attack, as did Democratic activists such as Nancy Pelosi’s daughter Christine Pelosi and social media influencer Majid Padellan, known as Brooklyn Dad Defiant. ""Ted Cruz is pro-choice?"" asked Ms Bee sarcastically. ""When you and this dude are on the same side, please rethink your position,"" said MSNBC host Tiffany D Cross. Around 90 per cent of NBA players have been vaccinated, while those who refuse could lose millions of dollars in missed salary due to local laws in cities such as New York and San Francisco that ban unvaccinated people from indoor sports events. According to The Hill, Mr Irving and Mr Wiggins have declined to reveal their vaccine status, with the former reportedly liking conspiracy theory posts on Instagram and latter applying for but being denied a religious exemption. Mr Beal and Mr Isaac have publicly criticised Covid-19 vaccines and questioned their effectiveness, leading to backlash from other players such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Natasha Cloud. Mr Cruz has a history of using Twitter to rile up his opponents, mimicking the strategy of former president Donald Trump by treating all outrage and mockery as a net boon. In January, the high-flying Princeton and Harvard Law School graduate, who once clerked for Supreme Court justice William Rehnquist, claimed that President Biden’s decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement showed he was “more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh”, despite probably knowing that the treaty was merely signed in Paris without any particular input from Parisians. Texas' Republican-controlled legislature has banned all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, giving citizens the right to sue any doctor who performs one. Around 60 per cent of abortions in the state happen after that point, according to federal health data, and many people do not realise they are pregnant until later. When the bill took effect on 1 September, Mr Cruz did not mention it at all in his tweets that day, despite being a prolific Twitter user. The next day his office issued a statement saying he was ""proud that Texas is leading the charge to defend life"".

2021-09-30	00:00:27+00:00	Unknown	ktts	Missouri Abortion Law Leads To Court Battle Over Referendums	https://www.ktts.com/2021/09/29/missouri-abortion-law-leads-to-court-battle-over-referendums/	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri law seeking to ban most abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy led to a legal battle Wednesday before the state’s highest court over whether the people’s right to overturn laws passed by the Legislature has been illegally limited by procedural hurdles. The case before the Missouri Supreme Court won’t ultimately affect the fate of the anti-abortion law — which currently is blocked by a separate federal court case — but could determine how easy or difficult it is for people to force a statewide vote on future laws they don’t like. The Missouri case is one of several battles around the nation over state election laws that supporters describe as safeguards but which opponents contend are unjustified limits on democracy. Missouri’s constitution includes a referendum right that allows people to challenge a law passed by Legislature by gathering petition signatures to put the measure to a public vote. Petitions must be submitted to the secretary of state’s office 90 days after the end of the legislative session during which the law passed. The American Civil Liberties Union and the group No Bans No Choice challenged those laws after Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft used much of the allotted time, leaving them little opportunity to gather enough signatures to force a referendum on the 2019 abortion law. Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem struck down the laws in December, ruling that “the State may not constitutionally delay the circulation of a referendum petition for the purpose of certifying a ballot title.” The state appealed to the Supreme Court. Attorney Jason Lewis, who argued on behalf of Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt, defended the laws as “reasonable regulations of the referendum process.” Schmitt’s office argued in court filings that the ballot title requirement “creates order and consistency, prevents voters from being confused or misled by complex bills, and promotes informed voter choices about whether to sign referendum proposals.” But the ACLU said in court filings that there is “conflict between the Constitution, which reserves a right of referendum to the people, and the two statutes, which curtail that right.” “The Legislature shouldn’t be given the tools to narrow or broaden that right beyond what the constitution provides,” said ACLU attorney Jessie Steffan, of St. Louis. Steffan argued that any law impeding the gathering of referendum signatures should be unconstitutional. Lewis said the fact that scenarios exist allowing enough time for signature gathering means the laws regulating referendums cannot be declared unconstitutional on their face. The 2019 abortion law that prompted the legal fight sought to ban the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except for cases of medical emergencies. It included a stairstep of other abortion bans at 14, 18, or 20 weeks should one of the earlier-term restrictions get struck down in court. It also sought to ban abortions based solely on race, sex or a diagnosis indicating Down syndrome. The abortion law has never been enforced, because a federal judge blocked it a day before it was scheduled to take effect. The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments last week on an appeal of the injunction, but a ruling isn’t expected for at least several weeks.

Tom Cotton said Wednesday that Democrats have discarded Bill and Hillary Clinton’s “safe, legal, and rare” stance on abortion because it implies that there is “something wrong about the practice.” Cotton questioned Democratic Texas State Rep. Donna Howard on her abortion stances Wednesday during a Senate Judiciary Committee, asking Howard whether she agreed with the Clintons that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare.” (RELATED: The Clintons Coined The Phrase ‘Safe, Legal And Rare,’ But Abortion Activists Say This Is Stigmatizing) “I would think that there’s a lot of options that we could put in place that would limit the need for abortion in terms of supporting healthcare for women, access to contraceptives, making sure that they have insurance coverage or Medicaid coverage,” Howard told Cotton. “There are many things that we could do that would give them more choice in their own, how they have healthcare, so that they don’t necessarily have an unwanted pregnancy,” she continued. “But when they do have one, I think they have a right to make the decision about whether or not they want to continue that pregnancy.” Cotton fired back at Texas representative, telling her that her “unwillingness to say yes” demonstrates his point that “Democrats today will not concede what Bill and Hillary Clinton conceded, that abortion should be rare, because it implies that there is something wrong about the practice.” “It is wrong and the Democrats will no longer recognize that it is wrong,” he said. (RELATED: Hillary Clinton: Tulsi Is A ‘Favorite Of The Russians’) “Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal but rare,” said Bill Clinton in January 1993 as he explained the Clinton administration’s attempts to reduce abortions. The former U.S. president echoed these sentiments during his presidential nomination acceptance speech in 1996, saying, “We respect the individual conscience of every American on the painful issue of abortion but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be left to a woman, her conscience, her doctor and her God. But abortion should not only be safe and legal; it should be rare.” Hillary Clinton has also repeatedly used the phrase to discuss how abortions should be approached. On the campaign trail in 2005 she said: “We can support a woman’s right to choose that makes abortions safe, legal and rare and reduces the number of abortions.” The former first lady also re-iterated the sentiment during her 2008 presidential run, saying, “By rare, I mean rare,” but later tweaked her language during the 2016 presidential election and said abortion should be merely “safe and legal.” Former presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard also referenced the Clinton phrase during the 2020 presidential debates. “I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal and rare, I think she’s correct,” Gabbard said in October 2019. Her comments were widely criticized by abortion advocates, though former Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen defended her. Screenshot, Twitter.

2021-09-29	21:46:51+00:00	Fort Worth Weekly	fwweekly	Women’s March Saturday	https://www.fwweekly.com/2021/09/29/womens-march-saturday/	The Fort Worth Women’s March is one of hundreds of similar rallies that will pop up across the country on Saturday. The annual march usually takes place in January. This year the national nonprofit Women’s March has encouraged fall rallies in response to the abortion ban in Texas and in anticipation of future court cases that could roll back access to abortion in other states. The Tarrant County Democratic Women’s Club and the Tarrant County Democratic Women’s Club are co-hosting the local event. “We are hoping, both individually as Fort Worth and as a national movement, to alert the Supreme Court … that women are not going to accept overturning Roe v. Wade,” said co-organizer Vicki Moore. The Supreme Court’s new term begins Monday. The rally portion will take place on the eastside steps of the Tarrant County Courthouse downtown. Representative Nicole Collier; Tarrant County Democratic Party Chair Allison Campolo and Executive Director Iris Garcia; and Crystal Gayden, attorney and candidate for Judge of the 324th Family District Court, will all speak. They will be joined by two local women sharing stories about their abortions. Afterward, the rally will walk a mile loop to the Fort Worth Convention Center on Houston Street and back. Moore said she hopes for anywhere between 1,000 to 5,000 attendants. “Every single [person] that cares about their rights and the rights of others should turn out,” she said. — Madison Simmons Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Sotomayor made her comments during a Zoom appearance Wednesday at an American Bar Association event. The justice answered a question from a law student by saying that members of the public won’t always like the results courts reach. She said: “Your ability is to go out there and work to change the law. Work to make those things that are important to you work better, be better.” Sotomayor is one of three liberal justices on a nine-member court. 
2021-09-29	20:50:36+00:00	Angie Leventis Lourgos	Chicago Tribune	Abortion rights rallies — sparked by new restrictions in Texas — planned Saturday for Chicago, hundreds of cities across the nation	https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-abortion-rights-rallies-preview-20210929-zkep44javvgifibxajbexyyhvu-story.html#ed=rss_www.chicagotribune.com/arcio/rss/category/news/	 Reproductive rights activists are hosting marches and rallies across Illinois on Saturday to support abortion access nationwide and protest recent restrictions in Texas, which have all but banned the procedure there. The two largest “Defend Abortion Access” events will be in Chicago at Daley Plaza and in Springfield at Old State Capitol Plaza. Both are scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m. with speakers starting at noon. Roughly two dozen smaller marches and rallies are also planned this weekend in the Chicago suburbs and other cities across the state, such as Carbondale and Rockford. These events will be held in concert with hundreds of similar reproductive rights marches and rallies planned in other cities around the country this weekend, including Rally for Abortion Justice in Washington, D.C., March for Reproductive Rights in Los Angeles and the Boston Rally to Defend Abortion. Planned Parenthood of Illinois — along with about 19 other local activist and health care groups — is organizing the events in Chicago and Springfield. “Everyone deserves the freedom to make their own medical decisions in consultation with their families and their doctors, and free from political interference,” said Planned Parenthood of Illinois in a news release. “Access to essential health care should never depend on where you live or how much money you make, and we will never stop fighting to help all people access the health care they need and deserve.” The U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to block a controversial Texas law that bans most abortions as early as six weeks gestation, before most women know they’re pregnant. The measure is one of many so-called “heartbeat laws” passed in various states, which try to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Other similar statutes, though, have been blocked by the courts, citing Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that established the right to terminate a pregnancy. The Texas Heartbeat Act is unusual in its approach because it permits any private citizen to sue abortion providers or others helping in the process of terminating a pregnancy — including a driver offering a ride to a clinic or anyone funding the procedure. Many abortion rights activists fear other states might follow suit and attempt to pass more restrictive laws. Illinois has firmly protected abortion rights, passing the Reproductive Health Act in 2019, which established the “fundamental right” to terminate a pregnancy here. But many neighboring states in the Midwest, as well as others in the southern United States, have passed more barriers to the procedure in recent years, including tighter gestational limits, restrictions on abortion providers, mandatory waiting periods and other legal hurdles. Reproductive rights activists and groups that oppose abortions have predicted tighter restrictions in other states will spur more women to travel to Illinois for the procedure. “I think we’re definitely going to be seeing higher abortion rates in Illinois,” Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, told the Tribune in early September. “That trend will continue as other states enact other pro-life measures, whether we’re talking about measures that have already been upheld by the Supreme Court or measures that are completely new, like this Texas law.” Thousands of women already cross state lines to terminate a pregnancy in Illinois each year. In 2019, about 7,500 out-of-state women came to Illinois to have an abortion, roughly 16% of all terminated pregnancies statewide that year. The number of women coming from other states for abortions access has increased every year since 2014, according to Illinois Department of Public Health data. The slew of reproductive rights marches and rallies this weekend come just before the U.S. Supreme Court reconvenes for its new term in October. On Dec. 1, the court is expected to hear a major reproductive rights case from Mississippi that could challenge Roe v. Wade. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will test the legality of a Mississippi law that bans most abortions before 15 weeks — and could determine whether any state law that bans terminating a pregnancy before viability is legal. “Protecting the legal right to abortion in the courts is essential, but it’s not enough,” said the Chicago Abortion Fund, a nonprofit that provides financial and logistical support for those seeking an abortion, in a news release. “We must work together to build a future where everyone has full reproductive freedom and is met with compassion and respect as they exercise their right to decide what is best for themselves and their families.” Where: Daley Plaza, 50 W.

2021-09-29	20:47:33+00:00	Unknown	socialistalternative	We Need A Mass Movement to Defend Abortion Rights	https://www.socialistalternative.org/2021/09/29/we-need-a-mass-movement-to-defend-abortion-rights/	In 1973, Roe v. Wade, which was originally filed in the state of Texas, ruled the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to an abortion, and that this right could not be subject to excessive government interference. This was the result of a titanic women’s movement, with radical politics that spent years organizing from the ground up to win reproductive rights. That was 48 years ago and the right wing counter-movement has been fighting to have it overturned ever since. And because of their fight we’re right back to where the state was before 1973 with the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 this year. The U.S. Supreme Court barely commented on the bill and refused to block it from going into effect on the first of September. This paints a worrying picture for another major threat on the horizon: the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case which would overturn Roe, and will be heard by the Court starting on December 1. The barbaric and unprecedented Texas law bans abortion as early as 5 to 6 weeks into a pregnancy, on the basis of when a fetal “heartbeat” can be detected. This covers 85-90 percent of abortions. There are no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The ban will slip through the courts on the basis of its unique method of civil enforcement: rather than the government, the bill allows anti-abortion ‘vigilantes’ to sue a patient, a doctor and/or clinic, or anyone who aids and abets an abortion procedure for a bounty of up to $10,000. It is now official that any person who wants or needs an abortion cannot get one in the state of Texas. On top of all this, the reproductive services that were provided by clinics like mammograms, Pap smears, cancer screenings, testing for STDs, and so on are no longer being provided for free or at cost for working and poor people due to closures of these clinics because of the fear of the escalating numbers of lawsuits.. Now the first month of the ban is almost over and not much else has happened. Between the Democrats and reproductive rights nonprofits like Planned Parenthood, NOW, and NARAL, who issued public statements but no calls to action, millions of angry young women have been left wondering why more isn’t happening. Senate Bill 8 places any doctor who performs an abortion in the path of potentially crippling civil lawsuits. And, in a stand against this barbaric law, one Texas doctor, Dr. Alan Braid of San Antonio, has put himself in the crosshairs of a suit in order to challenge the law. He provided a medically necessary abortion after the ban went into effect and wrote an op-ed to declare what he had done and why. At this point, two lawsuits have been filed against him. This open defiance of the law is what we need – and even more importantly, we need to rally the public in solidarity with providers and patients who defy the ban, as part of a resistant movement to wholesale overturn the savage ban. Already clinics in nearby Oklahoma and Kansas are reporting a surge in people seeking abortion services. There are groups that provide abortion funds to assist any person who can afford to take time off from work and/or find someone to take care of their children while they travel hundreds of miles to the “closest” clinic to get what should be a private and simple medical procedure. Since they now have to go out state, they also have to check and make sure they are complying with another state’s abortion laws. Meanwhile, Florida has introduced a bill of their own modeled after Texas, and other states are sure to follow. This barrage of attacks will continue until Roe v. Wade is either overturned wholesale, or made law once and for all. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives passed a law that would codify Roe v. Wade and establish abortion rights at the federal level. But without abolishing the filibuster, the bill will not make it through the Senate and it will amount to little more than a performance. Biden’s Justice Department has filed a lawsuit to challenge the ban, but it is based on shaky legal arguments and will take time to wind its way through the courts — time that working class people and families cannot afford to waste. The Texas ban is being imposed at a time when reproductive rights are being won and expanded in other countries. From Ireland to Argentina and most recently in Mexico, womens movements are either winning or expanding abortion rights. These movements have taken up the tactics of protests, student walkouts, strikes, and other militant actions to fight against the far right. At the same time, countries like Poland and China have issued restrictions on abortion rights, and it is critical that we organize an international working-class movement, acting in solidarity and sharing lessons, that fights for abortion rights worldwide. In the U.S. the effort to defend abortion exclusively through legalistic means has not been enough to prevent the gradual reduction in abortion rights and access, and now finally the almost total elimination of reproductive choice in Texas. We need to revive the traditions that won Roe in the first place by getting organized in our schools, workplaces, and communities, carrying out bold tactics of escalation, and relying on working class solidarity, not the Democrats, to win guaranteed free access to abortion for all. With the Dobbs case looming on the horizon, it is crucial that the October 2 days of action nationwide are continued. The next several months will be a critical time for organizing, building power in our workplaces, schools, and communities to fight the attacks and win. Our struggle for women’s liberation needs to go beyond the question of access to free, safe, and legal abortion. This ban and others like it will impact poor and working-class people the most, imposing desperation on top of an already desperate housing crisis and childcare crisis. We need a mass struggle for free, excellent reproductive care including universal childcare, rent control and high quality, publicly owned housing. We need an end to health care profiteering and an immediate transition to Medicare for All. A socialist struggle has to take up the struggle against racism, transphobia, and terror against immigrants as all forms of oppression serve only to divide the working class from one another. Today’s generation of young women are not sold on “girlboss” glass-ceiling liberal feminism, and there is a deep hunger for fundamental change that puts a decisive end to the crises and exploitation we see all around us. Under capitalism, every gain painstakingly won by our movement, such as Roe v. Wade, can be rolled back by the ruling class. Winning genuine liberation from gender oppression will require channeling the anger at this rotten system into a mighty struggle for a socialist future.

Ms Bush detailed the attack in an interview published in Vanity Fair on Wednesday, and pledged to talk in more detail about her experience at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Thursday. “Tomorrow, I will share a story that I’ve never fully told publicly before. I am testifying at the Oversight Committee hearing on abortion care and I will share that when I was 17, I was raped, became pregnant, and got an abortion. And I am not ashamed,” she wrote on Twitter. In her interview with Vanity Fair, Ms Bush explains that the rape occurred when she was 17, and attending a church camp in Jackson, Miss. After she shared to a mutual friend that she was romantically interested in an older counselor, who she said was in his early 20s, the young man asked to come over to Ms Bush’s room to socialise. According to the congresswoman, the two talked for a while before the man suddenly began taking her clothes off and got on top of her. “I just remember I was laying there and I just didn’t know what was happening … I couldn’t make it make sense,” she told Vanity Fair, adding of the encounter: “all of a sudden we went from talking to, he was on top. He was like taking my clothes off ... He’s having sex, penetrating me”. On Thursday, the Oversight panel is set to have a discussion regarding “the urgent need to expand abortion rights and access”. The hearing comes on the heels of the implementation of a ban on abortions after six weeks in the state of Texas, as well as a court challenge launched by Mississippi seeking to overturn Roe V Wade and end the Supreme Court-established right to an abortion nationwide. Democrats have reacted to the recent events with alarm; progressives in particular are pushing the Biden administration to either expand the Supreme Court and weaken its conservative majority, or codify abortion rights into federal law; both prospects look highly unlikely given current political realities in Washington. The recent decision by the conservative-dominated Supreme Court to allow Texas’s ban to go into effect has only emboldened progressives who argue that the Court should be expanded to prevent a rollback of women’s rights. Ms Bush joined those calls as recently as April, tweeting “expand the Court”, after President Joe Biden announced the formation of a panel to explore potential reforms to the Court.

Ted Cruz slammed Senate Democrats for holding a hearing Wednesday on his state's restrictive abortion law, saying they were doing so to 'demonize Texas' because blue state residents were 'fleeing' for Texas and Florida. 'Look, what this is really about is trying to demonize Texas and trying to demagogue on the question of life,' Cruz said during his turn to ask questions at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. He said that 'when it comes to demonizing Texas' he understood the Democrats' incentive to do so. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz slammed Senate Democrats for holding a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his state's restrictive abortion law, accusing them of trying to 'demonize Texas' because blue state voters were moving there Cruz pointed a finger at Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. 'I just looked up the statistics in the year 2020 of what states people are moving out of. The No. 1 state is New Jersey, the No. 2 state is New York, the No. 3 state is Illionois,' Cruz noted. 'Where do the people from Illinois go? Clearly they don't go to the hellholes like Texas or Florida.' 'Well, no, actually that's exactly where they go,' he continued. 'They go to Texas and Florida. Why? Because we actually have jobs there, we have low taxes and we protect people's rights.' The controversial Texas law went into effect on September 1 and bans abortions after six weeks. It doesn't include a carve-out for victims of rape or incest. It also emboldens citizens to rat out people seeking abortion and those helping them. It's been called a 'heartbeat' bill because an ultrasound can start detecting a flutter - of where a baby's eventual heart will be - around this time. Republicans have pointed to that as proof of life. 'The last I checked clumps of cells don't have heartbeats,' Cruz said at the hearing. Witnesses, including Texas state Rep. Donna Howard, pushed back on this idea explaining to the senators that 'the bill is based on a false premise that is meant to tug at one's heartstrings: No abortion after a fetal heartbeat or cardiac activity can be detected.' 'Developmentally, the embryo has no beating heart at six week's gestation, but cardiac cells that emit electical activity can be amplified by a trans-vaginal sonogram and translated into a ""whoosh, whoosh"" sound as early as six weeks gestation - which is actually four weeks of pregnancy, which is only two weeks past a missed period, if you happen to have regular periods and keep up with them, which means before many even know they are pregnant,' Howard testified. The law is the most restrictive in the country and could be used to challenge the 1973 landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade. 'As someone who came of age pre-Roe v. Wade when it was not only illegal to get an abortion but also to get contraceptives, I can tell you I'm very concerned about going back and erasing all the progress we've made over the past century,' Howard said. 'Women's ability to pursue education and employment opportunities over that time has been greatly enhanced by the ability to have autonomy over their own bodies, something that men enjoy despite the fact that they share 50 per cent of the responsiblity of the pregnancy, but oftentimes zero per cent of the consequences,' she added. The Supreme Court refused to immediately block the law. The court's decision stated it wasn't a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute. 'Texas made a perfectly reasonable decision to protect life. Life is valuable,' Cruz went on. He called Democrats 'radical and extreme' on the issue of abortion. Both Cruz and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, questioned the appropriateness of the hearing. At the top of his remarks, Cruz knocked the Democratic leadership for not holding hearings on the southern border and 'big tech.' Sen. John Cornyn, Texas' other senator, also slammed Democrats in the hearing calling it 'part of a concerted effort to intimidate and bully the members of the Supreme Court' 'I would think if we were going to single out individual staes and individual cities that we can anticipate a future hearing on why the city of Chicago has the highest murder rates, among the highest murder rates of the nation,' Cornyn said, a remark aimed at Durbin. He added, 'I think it's really inappropriate for the federal government - for the Senate Judiciary Committee - to try and single out individual states.' Cornyn came armed with a poster knocking a bill passed in the House last week that aims to codify Roe v. Wade, portraying it as too extreme. Cornyn also called the hearing 'part of a concerted effort to intimidate and bully the members of the Supreme Court.' At the hearing, Democrats and Republicans bickered over whether it was appropriate for the Supreme Court to use the so-called 'shadow docket.' The terms refers to when the justices break from standard procedure and make a ruling sans explanation. The Court didn't hear oral arguments and based the decision not to intervene only on court filings. Durbin accused the conservative justices of using the maneuver when it aligns with their political biases. 'The Supreme Court has now shown that it is willing to allow even facially unconstitutional laws to take effect when the laws align with certain ideological preferences,' he said in his opening remarks. 'Constitutional rights for millions of Americans should not be stripped away in the dark of night, even at the Supreme Court,' Durbin said. 'It is already too late for many Texans whose rights have been suspended, and who have been forced to leave the state to seek reproductive health care the Constitution already guarantees them. But it is not too late for the rest of the country and the Court to change course,' he added. The comments below have not been moderated.

2021-09-29	19:41:14+00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-agren	The Guardian	Amlo ridiculed for saying Mexico’s feminist movement began two years ago	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/29/mexico-amlo-president-feminist-movement	Last modified on Wed 29 Sep 2021 17.14 EDT Mexico’s president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has picked yet another fight with the country’s burgeoning feminist movement, saying it only started “two years ago” and bizarrely claiming it had been formed to oppose his administration. Asked on Wednesday about a march in Mexico City for International Safe Abortion Day, the president spoke conspiratorially of the women’s movement, alleging it had become “conservative” – a term he uses to deride his critics. “You have to see what’s behind it, because two years ago, when the feminist movement began, many women participated. But you started to realize they had become conservative feminists only to affect us, only for this purpose,” he said. His remarks were the latest evidence of the populist leader’s hostility toward the feminist movement – which includes many people who previously supported him. Mexican social media responded with ridicule and bewilderment. “With this man, he believes everything revolves around him,” tweeted Martha Tagle, a former opposition senator. “[López Obrador] doesn’t understand feminism and what little he does understand he considers it to be contrary to his political project,” said Bárbara González, a political analyst in Monterrey. Some in the feminist movement expressed early hopes for López Obrador’s administration, which he promotes as the “fourth transformation” in Mexico’s history. He appointed a gender-balanced cabinet and named prominent former supreme court justice Olga Sánchez Cordero to the interior ministry. But Sánchez Cordero was replaced in late August – and returned to the senate – after a low-profile period in what was traditionally Mexico’s most powerful cabinet position. “The kind of woman that does politics acceptably for him is an ‘Adelita’,” González said, referring to the women who fought as foot soldiers in Mexico’s revolution of 1910. “It’s an archetype, the model of a woman that accompanies the transformation.” The president’s comments come barely three weeks after the supreme court decriminalised abortion – a subject the president has barely mentioned. The court decision followed waves of protests in Mexico and across Latin America as women took to the streets to demand action on issues such as sexual violence, abortion access and femicide. A recent report from Amnesty International found that at least 10 women and girls are murdered in Mexico every day. Most of the cases go unpunished and families of the victims are often forced to carry out their own investigations.
2021-09-29	18:30:56+00:00	Unknown	arktimes	Runaway senate expands their focus beyond redistricting, danger ahead	https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2021/09/29/runaway-senate-expands-their-focus-beyond-redistricting-danger-ahead	State lawmakers came back to the Capitol today after an extended recess to consider proposed new maps for redistricting, but the process got hijacked almost immediately by Trumpian lawmakers angling to add anti-vax, anti-Biden and anti-reproductive rights measures to the agenda. A number of Republican senators, including Senate president pro tempore Jimmy Hickey of Texarkana and Jonathan Dismang of Beebe, argued in favor of focusing only on redistricting, a path attorney Marty Garrity advised was wise. Garrity, the director of the Bureau of Legislative Research, cited a 1980 Arkansas Supreme Court case that struck down measures lawmakers passed during a special session that went beyond what the call asked them to do. “I don’t want to pass a bunch of bills that have no chance of going anywhere because they’re not germane to our business,” Dismang said. Former Republican turned Independent Jim Hendren of Gravette also argued that law and precedent call for lawmakers to focus only on redistricting. He said he’d never seen “a deluge of bills” outside the scope of business like the ones that piled up Wednesday. Those bills mainly aim to protect anti-maskers and anti-vaccinators from losing jobs or allow them to get unemployment benefits if they do. But the vote to stick to only redistricting bills was a 16-16 tie in the Senate, and it needed a majority of votes to pass. Three senators, Republicans Ron Caldwell and Lance Eads and Democrat Stephanie Flowers, didn’t vote. Sen. Cecile Bledsoe, chair of the Senate Public Health Committee, didn’t allow for debate in her extremely brief meeting Wednesday afternoon, but instead passed the anti-vaccine bills back to be considered and debated on the Senate floor tomorrow. State senators vote to expand beyond redistricting in this extended session. The Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee took up anti-vaccination bills Wednesday afternoon. In an agreed deal, it sent a batch of anti-vax bills to the floor for debate. It sent eight of 12 bills, excluding four sponsored by Sen. Trent Garner. They create a dubious right of privacy, prevent private businesses and public accommodations from setting vaccination requirements and otherwise take as many steps possible to put the vaccinated in harms way from a minority of resisters. The House committee is to meet later this afternoon. A Trumpian contingent of Republican lawmakers celebrated this small victory on the Capitol steps at noon, at an unusual Christian-themed rally headlined by gun lover and perpetual political candidate Jan Morgan. Senators Trent Garner, Bob Ballinger, Alan Clark and Jason Rapert spoke to the unmasked crowd, whipping them up with anti-mask, anti-vaccine and anti-immigrant diatribes, and something about liberty and freedom. “This presidential administration is evil,” Sen. Alan Clark told the crowd, eliciting loud cheers. We covered some of the mask hysteria procedural debate earlier.

Ms Greene was speaking to right-wing streaming site Real America’s Voice when she said that the federal government should restrict reproductive rights in order to protect the “souls” of women and make them “better people” by removing access to abortion care. “If we really care about women, like, like we say we do, then we should be telling women that the best thing they can ever do in their whole life is to be a mother,” Ms Greene told the outlet. “Being a mother is the greatest thing I have ever done in my whole life, no matter what I do my entire life,” she added. “I will never do anything greater than being a mother, it is a true gift, whether a pregnancy is planned, whether the baby is born perfectly healthy or not. Being a mother is life-changing, life-altering, and makes women better people.” She went on to claim that abortions “are actually things that can scar your body, they hurt you internally. And they not only that they scar your soul, and women have to live with this. We should care for women, love for women and teach them, you know how to care for themselves, and that would be being proud to be a mom”. Ms Greene shouted at Democratic lawmakers on the steps of the USCapitol last week, making the false claim that they were “killing babies until birth”. Michigan Democrat Debbie Dingell told Ms Greene: “You try being a Christian and start treating your colleagues decently.” The confrontation arose after the House passed the Women’s Health Protection Act almost completely along party lines, with 218 people voting for it and 211 against it. Texas Representative Henry Cuellar was the only Democrat to vote against it. The proposal would codify the protections for abortion as devised in Roe v Wade. Democrats passed the legislation after a law in Texas went into effect that restricts abortion as soon as cardiac activity is discovered – usually six weeks into a pregnancy and before most people are aware that they are pregnant. “I said, ‘Are you happy you passed a bill that babies can be slaughtered up until the day of birth?’” Ms Greene told Real America’s Voice about the confrontation on the Capital steps. “There were so many Democrats and they have their signs: ‘Build Back Better Women.’ How on Earth is it making women better by creating a law where they can kill a baby in their womb even though the baby is about to be born? How are we building back better women when we’re turning men into women? “And so I just started speaking out,” she added. “Most of them weren’t saying anything to me but it was Debbie Dingell – like a dingleberry – she started fussing at me, telling me I needed to be civil to my colleagues and act the way I would act going to church.” Ms Greene’s comments sparked an immediate backlash. “What would you know about one’s ‘soul’? You are minus a soul, a conscience, any morals, or any facts or proven truths. If you have children, I guarantee they are ‘scarred,’” one Twitter user wrote in response to Ms Greene’s comments on Wednesday. “Yah, those two c-sections where I nearly died did wonders for my body and soul. No scarring what so ever,” Kristin Blackson wrote. “These people think the Handmaid’s Tale is an instruction manual,” Keller West noted. “Abortion bans don’t stop abortion. They stop safe abortions. Seeing women as complete people rather than as incubators means letting them make their own choices. Make motherhood a free/informed choice through social program support and education. Watch abortions drop,” Twitter user D66 Labs added. “It’s good for me, therefore it HAS to be good for you also. Seems not very logical or loving,” another account holder wrote.

2021-09-29	17:00:20+00:00	Pierce Singgih | psinggih@scng.com | San Gabriel Valley Tribune	Press-Telegram	Long Beach women’s march set for Saturday, Oct. 2	https://www.presstelegram.com/2021/09/29/long-beach-womens-march-set-for-saturday-oct-2/	A women’s march will take place this Saturday, Oct. 2 in Long Beach as part of the National Women’s March. The march will begin at 10 a.m. and will start at Deukmejian Courthouse, 275 Magnolia Ave., and will go through downtown to Harvey Milk Park, a press release announced. The march is part of a national movement for reproductive rights in response to recent anti-abortion laws in Texas and Mississippi. “Abortion care is a critical component of healthcare. It needs to be equitable and accessible for everyone regardless of their socioeconomic status,” said state Sen. Lena Gonzales in a statement. Her district encompasses parts of Long Beach and the South Bay. “California has been a leader in reproductive freedom and we will continue fighting these national attacks that threaten the quality of life for so many in our state and country.” A recent Texas law banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and allows state residents to sue clinics, doctors, nurses and people who drive women to get an abortion for damages of up to $10,000. The Supreme Court voted 5-4 not to block the law, the Associated Press reported. A 2018 Mississippi law banned abortions after 15 weeks. The Supreme Court will hear that case in December, the AP reported. Protesters will march across the nation and in Long Beach, the press release said, hoping to send a message to the Supreme Court. “Women’s bodies are not political footballs,” Jeannine Pearce said in a statement. Pearce is a former Long Beach City Councilwoman and founder of Fierce Courage Consulting. “We demand that Roe v. Wade be codified by Congress so that Federal law allows for safe access to abortions,” she added. “Unfortunately, even where already permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services — this is due not only to lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will, but also mistrust of a system that has historically ignored the needs of black and brown women since its inception.” The Long Beach march is planned by The Women of Long Beach Political Action Committee, the North Pine Neighborhood Alliance and the Long Beach Resister Sisters, the statement said. They call for marchers to wear masks and maintain social distance at the protest. The march will end with live music and a poetry readings at the park. “Women in this country are at grave risk of losing our reproductive freedoms,” said Ennette Morton, a board member of the Women of Long Beach PAC. “Today, we join our sisters and allies across the country in lifting our voices to send a clear, unified message.” To volunteer or RSVP, visit womensmarch.com.

U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes on Tuesday also threw out another provision that would have let prosecutors bring charges against anyone who helped raise money or pay for abortions done solely because of genetic abnormality. The judge said the law’s criminal provisions were likely unconstitutionally vague, explaining it’s unclear at what point in the process doctors can be deemed to be aware that fetal genetic abnormality exists. Rayes also said another portion of the law made an incorrect statement by saying the statute requires providers to tell women that the law bars abortions because of genetic abnormality. The judge made clear the new law didn’t prohibit abortions because of a fetal genetic abnormality, nor did it necessarily bar doctors from performing such abortions. Instead, the law would prohibit doctors from performing such abortions if they know the woman’s motive, Rayes said. pregnancy because of a fetal genetic abnormality, wrote Rayes, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The ruling, however, did bring a partial victory for abortion opponents. The judge refused to put on hold a “personhood” provision that says the state will interpret all laws to confer the rights of people on unborn children, subject to the Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court rulings.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court term that begins next week is already full of contentious cases, including fights over abortion and guns, but the justices still have a lot of blank space on their calendar with four more months of arguments left to fill. As is typical, hundreds of cases have piled up over the summer awaiting the justices’ review. Before the new term opens Monday, the justices are expected to announce some additional cases they’ll hear. Monday will be the first time in more than a year and a half the justices have heard cases in person rather than by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. An abortion case already on the court’s calendar for December involves Mississippi, which is asking the justices to be allowed to enforce a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Mississippi law was enacted in 2018 but was blocked after a federal court challenge. Other abortion cases are waiting in the wings. Among the new appeals are cases from Arkansas and Missouri over their laws limiting abortions of fetuses with Down syndrome. Lower courts blocked those laws, but an appeals court upheld a similar law in Ohio. Religious groups also want the court to weigh in on a New York regulation that requires health insurance plans to cover abortions. The regulation upheld by lower courts exempts certain religious organizations, but the groups say it is still unconstitutional. The court could wait to act on some or all of the pending abortion cases until it resolves the Mississippi case. A case on the court’s calendar for November deals with the right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense, but gun owners also want the justices to take a case about a New Jersey law that bars citizens from owning firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The group says that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are standard for some of the most popular handguns in America. They want the court to say that New Jersey’s law and similar bans in seven other states and the District of Columbia are unconstitutional. Again, the court might wait to deal with the New York gun case before acting on the gun magazine case. A Catholic hospital is asking the justices to wade into the issue of transgender rights and overturn a lower court decision in favor of a transgender man who sought to have a hysterectomy. Mercy San Juan Medical Center near Sacramento declined to allow the procedure to be performed at its facility saying it was an “elective sterilization” that violated the hospital’s ethical and religious obligations. The patient, Evan Minton, got the surgery at a different hospital. He sued under a California law that bars discrimination. The justices could also vote to hear election law cases. In one, District of Columbia residents want the justices to reverse a lower court ruling that they’re not entitled to voting representation in the House of Representatives because they don’t live in a state. The Biden administration, meanwhile, wants the justices to hear a challenge to federal election law brought by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz’s challenge involves rules about repaying a candidate for federal office who loans his or her campaign money. Under the law, a campaign can repay the candidate up to $250,000 with money collected after the election. Cruz, a former Supreme Court clerk, loaned his campaign $260,000 as part of his successful 2018 reelection campaign in which he defeated Beto O’Rourke. The express purpose of the loan was to challenge the law. Several cases the court is weighing involve when law enforcement officers may be sued for violating people’s constitutional rights. One of the cases concerns a passenger in a vehicle who was fatally shot by police in Hayward, California. The driver was suspected of being drunk, and there is a dispute over whether the officer was facing a threat when he fired the fatal shot. A federal appeals court revived a suit filed by the victim’s brother, and the city is asking the justices to step in. Union opponents in Washington state are challenging a public records law that allows unions, but not the general public, to obtain contact information for in-home health care workers. A federal appeals court ruled the law doesn’t violate the Constitution, but the challengers want the court to follow up on recent rulings against organized labor by taking up their case. The contact information would enable union opponents to more easily try to persuade the health care providers to stop paying union dues. The Philadelphia-area transit system is appealing a lower court ruling that would force it to display ads touting a prize-winning investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting into racial bias in the mortgage market. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority refused to run the ads, saying they violated its ban on political advertising, but the federal appeals court in Philadelphia found that the policy had been applied inconsistently and held that the decision violated the rights of the news organization.

Former President Barack Obama appointee, U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes, wrote that the provision “essentially requires providers to mislead their patients into believing that their constitutionally protected choice is unlawful,” according to the Associated Press.

Rayes also threw out a provision in the law that criminalized helping or paying for an abortion based solely on genetic abnormality, the publication reported, saying that the provisions were probably unconstitutionally vague because it is unclear at what point a doctor would know the baby had a genetic abnormality. The American Civil Liberties Union celebrated the news in a Tuesday evening tweet, saying that it will “keep doing everything in our power to ensure no one is forced to carry a pregnancy against their will regardless of where they live.” (RELATED: Arizona House Passes Bill Banning Abortions Based On Genetic Abnormality) S.B. 1457 states that the rights of “an unborn child at every stage of development” must be acknowledged and prohibits abortions based on the sex, race, or genetic abnormality of the child.

A September 2011 study on perceptions of people with Down syndrome found that almost 99% of people with Down syndrome said they were happy with their lives and loved their families, 97% liked who they were and their brothers and sisters, and 96% liked how they look.

We've received your submission. PHOENIX — A judge has blocked a key portion of a new Arizona law that would have let prosecutors bring felony charges against doctors who knowingly terminate pregnancies solely because the fetuses have a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome. US District Judge Douglas Rayes on Tuesday also threw out another provision that would have let prosecutors bring charges against anyone who helped raise money or pay for abortions done solely because of genetic abnormality. The judge said the law’s criminal provisions were likely unconstitutionally vague, explaining it’s unclear at what point in the process doctors can be deemed to be aware that fetal genetic abnormality exists. Rayes also said another portion of the law made an incorrect statement by saying the statute requires providers to tell women that the law bars abortions because of genetic abnormality. The judge made clear the new law didn’t prohibit abortions because of a fetal genetic abnormality, nor did it necessarily bar doctors from performing such abortions. Instead, the law would prohibit doctors from performing such abortions if they know the woman’s motive, Rayes said. The provision “essentially requires providers to mislead their patients into believing that their constitutionally protected choice is unlawful” and would make it less likely that women will know they have the right to terminate a pregnancy because of a fetal genetic abnormality, wrote Rayes, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The ruling, however, did bring a partial victory for abortion opponents. The judge refused to put on hold a “personhood” provision that says the state will interpret all laws to confer the rights of people on unborn children, subject to the Constitution and US Supreme Court rulings. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office, which defended the law against the legal challenge, didn’t return a call seeking a comment on the ruling. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, which sponsored the legislation, said the ruling was only the first review of the law by the courts. “We remain confident the law will be upheld and ruled enforceable in its entirety,” Herrod said in a statement. Emboldened by the US Supreme Court’s turn to the right during former President Donald Trump’s administration, Republican-controlled legislatures around the country have embraced efforts to further restrict or outright ban abortion. States enacted more than 90 new restrictions on abortion this year, the most in decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. The high court in May signaled its willingness to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion before a fetus could survive outside a mother’s womb, generally around 24 weeks. And this month, the justices declined to block a Texas law that bans abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually around six weeks into a pregnancy — before some people know they’re pregnant. Down syndrome abortion bans have gained traction recently in several GOP-controlled states, such as Arizona and South Dakota. A three-judge federal appeals court panel has put on hold a sweeping 2019 Missouri law that includes some of the same provisions as Arizona’s, including the ban on abortions based on genetic abnormalities. That ruling is now being considered by the entire 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling on the Arizona law was issued just eight hours before it was to take effect. The measure was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey during the spring after it passed the GOP-controlled Legislature in party-line votes. The Center for Reproductive Rights and other groups that challenged the law said it was so vague that it would dissuade doctors from performing abortions anytime there’s an indication that the fetus might have a genetic problem for fear of criminal prosecution. Attorneys for the state argued the measures upholds Arizona’s interest in protecting the disability community from discrimination, preventing doctors from coercing women to abort fetuses believed to have genetic problems and upholding the integrity of the medical profession. The state’s lawyers also argued the law won’t block any woman from getting an abortion, though she might have to refuse to tell her doctor why she wants to terminate her pregnancy.

I will never do anything greater than being a mother, it is a true gift, whether a pregnancy is planned, whether the baby is born perfectly healthy or not. Being a mother is, is life changing, life altering, and makes women better people.” Last week Greene was caught on camera verbally accosting and harassing several Democratic women lawmakers on the steps of Congress, falsely accusing them of “killing babies up until birth.” On Wednesday Greene declared that abortions “are actually things that can scar your body they hurt you internally. And they not only that they scar your soul, and women have to live with this. We should care for women love for women and teach them, you know how to care for themselves, and that would be being proud to be a mom.” Any law banning abortion under the guise of protecting someone’s “soul” could arguably be considered unconstitutional.

Watch: AOC Takes Down Kevin McCarthy Ahead of Gosar Censure Vote: ‘What Is So Hard About Saying That This Is Wrong?’ ‘QAnon Shaman’ Sentenced After Citing Jesus, Gandhi, and Clarence Thomas Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church and, according to Catholics, God’s infallible representative on earth, last month called President Joe Biden a “good Catholic” and warned he should not be banned from receiving Holy Communion. The organization representing all American Catholic Bishops, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), will vote Wednesday on a document that would effectively act to ban President Biden from receiving Holy Communion, one of the most important sacraments to Catholics worldwide. “In a leaked draft of the document before the conference, the bishops write ‘there are some sins, however that do rupture the communion we share with God and the Church,'” ABC News reports. “As the Church has consistently taught, a person who receives Holy Communion while in a state of mortal sin not only does not receive the grace of the sacrament, he or she commits the sin of sacrilege by failing to show the reverence due to the Body and Blood of Christ,” the document said. Only the second Catholic ever elected President, Biden is possibly the most faithful and religious man the White House has seen in modern times, as ABC News notes: Biden, “who has said his ‘personal’ views were a ‘private matter,’ has openly professed his faith throughout his political career — diligently attending Sunday Mass, infusing speeches with scripture and wearing his late son Beau Biden’s rosary beads.” Biden personally opposes abortion, but strongly believes in a woman’s right to choose, and in protecting that right. The majority of U.S. Catholics say Biden should not be denied Holy Communion. In June 60 House Democrats signed a statement opposing “the weaponization of the Eucharist to Democratic lawmakers for their support of abortion.” The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has not shied away from cultural issues like same-sex marriage, but their unprecedented attacks against President Biden literally began on Inauguration Day. In a Jan. 20 letter “congratulating” Biden on becoming the nation’s 46th president, Archbishop Jose Gomez (photo), president of the USCCB, wrote: “I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.” That was the warning shot across the bow. Catholic Org Ramps Up Attack on Biden: Policies Are ‘Assault on Life, Marriage, Family, Sexuality’ That ‘Create Confusion’ A federal district court judge in Texas has ruled in favor of a longtime virulently anti-LGBTQ activist, deciding that for-profit businesses and religious entities like churches can discriminate against LGBTQ people in employment. The ruling comes more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County, that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ workers. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2007, ruled in favor of Dr. Steven Hotze (photo). In his ruling Judge O’Connor cited the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment, according to Bloomberg Law. In April of 2015 Dr. Hotze, a GOP powerbroker, compared same-sex marriage to the Holocaust and gay people to murderers, defending his belief that Texas should ignore the impending Supreme Court ruling that found same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marriage. Hotze filed the lawsuit in May on behalf of his Christian-based healthcare business, Braidwood Management Inc., and Bear Creek Bible Church, so they can “hire and fire in accordance with sincerely held religious beliefs and employment policies,” according to the 70-page ruling. Dr. Hotze in not only a business owner and anti-LGBTQ activist. He is deeply involved in Texas state politics. Last year Hotze demanded Gov. Greg Abbott order the National Guard to “shoot to kill” Black Lives Matter protestors marching against police brutality, especially the police shootings of unarmed Black men, according to the Texas Tribune. “I want you to give a message to the governor,” Hotze told Abbott’s chief of staff, Luis Saenz, in a voicemail. “I want to make sure that he has National Guard down here and they have the order to shoot to kill if any of these son-of-a-bitch people start rioting like they have in Dallas, start tearing down businesses — shoot to kill the son of a bitches. That’s the only way you restore order. Kill ’em. Thank you.” North Carolina’s Christian nationalist Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who recently announced that he’s “about 95 percent sure” that he will be running for governor in 2024, spoke at a Stand Up For America rally in Raleigh Friday morning, where he thundered that “the Christian patriots of this nation will own this nation and rule this nation.” Robinson began his speech by thanking God and declaring that anyone who doesn’t agree that the United States is a Christian nation is free to go live somewhere else. “You can leave God’s country, and we will not miss you,” Robinson said. Later, Robinson told the crowd that they are God’s regiment on Earth and “the living embodiment” of all those who have sacrificed their lives in defense of this nation. “Tell our enemies on the other side of the aisle that will drag this nation down into a socialist hellhole that you will only do it as you run past me laying on the ground, choking on my own blood because I will not give up this nation to you!” Robinson bellowed. “It is not yours. You did not build it, you did not defend it, and you will not own it. We will. The Christian patriots of this nation will own this nation and rule this nation and help freedom survive for future generations.” This article was originally published by Right Wing Watch and is republished here by permission. ‘QAnon Shaman’ Sentenced After Citing Jesus, Gandhi, and Clarence Thomas Chris Christie Went on Nicolle Wallace’s MSNBC Show.

2021-09-29	14:00:27+00:00	Associated Press	waow	High court could add more contentious cases to busy lineup	https://waow.com/2021/09/29/high-court-could-add-more-contentious-cases-to-busy-lineup/	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court term that begins next week is already full of contentious cases, including fights over abortion and guns. But the justices still have a lot of blank space on their calendar, with four more months of arguments left to fill. As is typical, hundreds of cases have piled up over the summer awaiting the justices’ review. Before the new term opens Monday the justices are expected to announce some additional cases they’ll hear. Cases on transgender rights, elections, police conduct and unions are among those the court could agree to hear.
2021-09-29	13:33:56+00:00	Heidi Crowter	Metro	When you have Down’s syndrome you experience discrimination even before being born	https://metro.co.uk/2021/09/29/downs-syndrome-people-like-me-experience-discrimination-before-birth-15334644/	Last year, I married the man of my dreams. We had a fantastic day even though we couldn’t have all our guests because of Covid-19 restrictions. James, 27, moved into my flat – we live amazing, happy and fulfilled lives. The only difference between us and anyone else is that we have Down’s syndrome (DS). A person with DS has 47 chromosomes unlike most other people who have 46. A few years ago my mum, Liz, told me that some people choose to abort babies with disabilities like Down’s syndrome – and it is legal to do so up to birth. This really upset me. Why should people like me be treated differently from other babies, who can only be aborted up to 24 weeks? I firmly believe that a blood test or scan does not tell the whole picture. I might have Down’s syndrome but I can achieve lots and have a wonderful existence. I know it is a complex decision for parents to make but I think it is wrong if medical professionals encourage parents to terminate a pregnancy just because a baby is disabled. I have heard about this happening and it is really sad. My mum and dad always treated me the same as my two older brothers, and my younger sister who was born when I was nearly two. In fact, I didn’t find out for a long time that I had Down’s syndrome. I think they probably told me when I was at primary school as I wanted to know why I had someone helping me all the time. All they said was that Down’s syndrome means I would learn to do things slightly slower than other children at school. Despite this, DS has never held me back. I don’t see why some people think there’s anything wrong with having an extra chromosome! I went to mainstream schools, got some qualifications and then went on to a hairdressing college where I gained an NVQ. I worked part time in a hairdressers which I loved, until Covid-19 came along and the salon had to shut. When mum told me about the discrimination against babies like me in the womb I felt like a knife had been put into my heart. It made me feel less valued than other people. ‘Late-term abortions’ continue to be justified for children with DS under the Abortion Act 1967 and I think it’s wrong. As someone who has Down’s syndrome, I find it extremely offensive that a law doesn’t respect my life. I realised nothing would change unless someone spoke out, so I started campaigning with Don’t Screen Us Out (DSUO) in 2016 and worked with medical professionals to bring in new testing ethically and fairly. We want the testing to be done not to ‘screen out’ people like me before they are born but, instead, to offer support to pregnant women and their families. Then, in December 2019, my mum helped me explore the possibility of me taking the Government to court. I was very keen because I want to get what I call the ‘Downright Discrimination law’ changed. I want babies with Down’s syndrome to be treated equally. Soon, we met with a solicitor, Paul Conrathe, who agreed to take the case. And so the long, very slow process began. After delays due to Covid-19, the hearing was last July – I was very excited as it is a landmark case; I am the first person with DS to take the Government to court. There were lots of meetings and discussions – my mum helped me in most of them – and we had to raise over £100,000 to pay for the legal fees. This was mostly achieved by posting on social media and people in the DS community donating and sharing our cause. We also had donations from DS support groups. We were joined by fellow campaigner Máire Lea-Wilson and her young son Aidan, who has DS. Máire found out Aidan would have DS when she was 34 weeks pregnant and was repeatedly asked if she wanted to terminate the pregnancy and she says she was given lots of outdated information about DS. It made her feel very scared and that continuing the pregnancy would be against medical advice. They made her feel like Aidan was not as valuable as his big brother. We aren’t arguing against a woman’s right to choose – I must stress, I respect that. But I want to be sure expectant mothers get the right information, and to be able to meet someone who has DS before they make a decision. I met Aidan, now two, in July and he is absolutely gorgeous – he loves pulling my glasses off and doing fist bumps! Seeing Aidan and the other children with DS outside the court, it made me feel so sad. I couldn’t help but think ‘Why would anyone not want a baby like that?’ There were lots of media at the court and loads of interviews, but I was pleased with how many people sent me supportive messages. It was exhausting but we had an enjoyable boat ride on the Thames to recover. I did not have to give a speech in court, Paul and the barrister did all the talking. I was disappointed when mum said I wouldn’t be speaking to the judges. But my written statement was presented to them and I was pleased my voice was being heard. Mum was told that the result would be given at the High Court in September. Travelling down from Coventry, I felt very nervous but also hopeful, although Mum kept reminding me that we might not win. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Last week, we attended the High Court – the result was announced on their website. We just sat in a small room and Paul talked us through the fact we had lost the case. I was so upset. I cannot understand why the judges feel that we are not equal to other people. That’s all I want – for unborn babies with Down’s syndrome to have the same rights as everyone else. There were lots of people with DS and other disabilities there and they were all upset too, but they said they were very proud of me for my work. I kept crying but I managed to read my speech outside the court. I said, ‘The fight is not over. ‘The verdict doesn’t change how I and thousands of people in the Down’s syndrome community feel. We face discrimination every day in schools, in the workplace and in society. Thanks to the verdict the judges have upheld discrimination in the womb too. ‘When Wilberforce wanted to change the law on slavery, he didn’t give up, even when events didn’t always go his way. And when the going got tough he kept going and I’m going to do the same, because I want to succeed.’ Then I thanked my mum, all my supporters and my husband James – planting a kiss on his lips for all the world to see. We are human just like everyone else. Now, I feel more determined than ever and we plan to appeal the decision. It is discrimination. I strongly feel the law affects the way people with disabilities view themselves and helps create negative stereotypes. I won’t stop until we are recognised as equal members of society. But to do that we need more money so if you are able to give some pennies towards our cause that would be fantastic. I believe that life is precious and that everyone should be valued however many chromosomes they have. As I said at the end of my speech: I’m not giving up. Let’s do this.

2021-09-29	13:20:51+00:00	Unknown	newswise	Mississippi's Ban on Abortions Puts Women and Families at Risk	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NewswiseLatestNews/~3/5jp7k01h_R4/	Newswise — WASHINGTON (Sept. 29, 2021) – Mississippi’s ban on nearly all abortions greater than 15 weeks forces women to carry pregnancies to term under adverse circumstances and increases the risk of maternal mortality and other health problems, according to a public health amicus brief filed in the United States Supreme Court on September 20th. The brief, submitted on behalf of the respondents in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is scheduled for oral argument before the Court on Dec. 1, 2021. The brief is signed by the American Public Health Association, The Guttmacher Institute, The Center for U.S. Policy and 547 deans, department chairs, leading academic scholars and public health professionals from across the nation. In the amicus brief, the scholars argue that Mississippi’s abortion ban–which provides no exception for rape or incest–runs counter to constitutional law and ignores the public health risks it creates for women and their families. The organizational and individual amici joined together in the brief to urge the Supreme Court to reject Mississippi’s law as unconstitutional. “As a pediatrician I have seen the adverse consequences to health and wellbeing when women are forced to carry unintended and unwanted pregnancies to term,” Lynn Goldman, Dean of the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said. “Mississippi’s ban, and others like it, disproportionately affects younger women, women of color, and communities already struggling with high maternal mortality rates, preterm births and other health burdens. They are an unwarranted intrusion on women’s constitutional rights, their privacy, and their ability to work with healthcare professionals to make the right decisions for their own health and that of their families.” In the brief, Goldman and the other amici point out that fourteen states with the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws, including Mississippi, invest the least in policies and programs aimed at improving the health of women and children. They also cite a Commonwealth Fund study of population health that ranks Mississippi last in the nation on a score that measures infant mortality, preventable death, and other benchmarks of child health. The amici call on the Supreme Court to affirm a lower court’s ruling declaring Mississippi’s law unconstitutional. They further argue that objective evidence overwhelmingly points to abortion access as a necessary tool in promoting health and in mitigating health threats to women and their families. The brief can be accessed here. The amici are represented by attorneys Edward T. Waters, Phillip A. Escoriaza and Rosie Dawn Griffin of Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell, LLP of Washington, DC.

Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, unless of course the Court's refusal to block Texas's abortion law already did that. Last Friday, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said in an interview with the Catholic TV network EWTN that if the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, were to overturn Roe, it would actually ""empower"" women. You see, every woman who wants to ""have it all"" can have a baby and a career, and women who only want a career can also have a baby and a career, which is clearly a bonus. The Mississippi Free Press watched so we wouldn't have to. Fitch was positively brimming with excellent news for all women, whether they want control over their own bodies or not: Unless what you want to be is no longer pregnant, but Fitch just said you can have whatever you want, so you clearly wouldn't want that. Instead, she explained, ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dream and goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Guess that covers all the options: having children and a career, or just having children. What an amazing modern world Mississippi is opening up for the mothers of tomorrow! What about women who didn't want children? Oddly, that somehow didn't make it into the conversation. Are there really such women, after all? You'd think Fitch would mention them if there were, so there aren't. Besides, this is about God's plan to empower women by giving them babies! Sometimes that is ""more babies,"" because they already have some, but is there such thing as too much empowerment? Reporter Ashton Pittman notes Fitch made a slightly similar claim, albeit a bit less chirpily, and minus the God stuff, in the state's formal argument to the Supreme Court in the case, asserting that the old-fashioned restrictive choices for women that informed Roe are simply not a problem that women today have to think about! For one thing, contraception is far more readily available (for now) than in 1972, and presumably it works flawlessly, doesn't it? And with Obamacare, women don't even have to pay for birth control! Lucky thing last year's Texas lawsuit against the ACA, which Fitch signed on to, didn't eliminate that, huh? Further, Fitch argued, having a child is no longer a burden of any kind, unlike in 1973: The Free Press notes that a group of economists filed an amicus (or WTF?) brief with the Court, specifically challenging Fitch's assertions, calling them ""particularly bizarre, as the United States is one of only two countries without a national paid maternity leave policy,"" and noting that even the US's existing law providing 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave is only available to about half of working women because the law has so many exceptions. The economists also noted that childcare is often prohibitively expensive, and not even a realistic option for many low-wage workers whose shift times frequently change, and which include nights and weekends. As for federally funded daycare, forget it because only one in six eligible parents can actually get in. Maybe Fitch should support Joe Biden's Build Back Better agenda! Fitch's claims are further belied by the demographics of women who actually seek abortions, the economists said. Roughly 75 percent The brief also cites a 2020 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research that compared the outcomes of women who either got abortions ""just prior to a gestational age cutoff"" and those who were denied abortions because they went to clinics later than the cutoff point. Not a big surprise: The women who were able to get the abortions they sought had significantly fewer financial hardships five years later than the women who had to carry the pregnancies to term: Then again, if Mississippi really is able to ban abortion altogether, that disparity would go away, at least among women who couldn't get themselves the fuck out of Gilead, so maybe Fitch has a point. They'll all be so happy with the babies the state will make them have, and if they aren't, well they're just not doing it right. What a blessing! [Mississippi Free Press / Dobbs v.

The bill would allow public and private employees to secure exemptions from mandated coronavirus vaccinations for three main reasons. Those are for a negative medical reaction to the vaccine, proven natural immunity as demonstrated by the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, and reasons of conscience including religious convictions. Abortion rights protesters rally inside Statehouse(AP) — More than 100 abortion rights protesters rallied inside the Ohio Statehouse and briefly entered the Senate chamber on Tuesday. State troopers escorted the protesters from the Senate chamber, where lawmakers had just adjourned their session. Groups organizing the protest included Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, the Ohio Women's Alliance, and Planned Parenthood. The protest came a day before the Senate Health Committee was scheduled to hear a bill that would ban abortions in Ohio in the event of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Ohio sees COVID spike in cases(WKSU) -- Ohio on Tuesday saw a spike in COVID-19 cases after dropping below the three-week average for several days. There were more than 7,200 logged yesterday. The state also reported another 125 COVID-19 deaths, a number that’s updated twice a week. There were 424 new COVID-19 hospitalizations reported statewide Tuesday and 29 new ICU admissions. State, Cuyahoga Co. offers vaccine incentives for employees(WKSU) -- State employees who get a COVID-19 vaccine can now get up to $1,000 in bonuses. Gov. Mike DeWine’s office said Tuesday that in addition to the current $100 bonus, state workers can get another $300 if 65% of their agency’s employees have received at least one dose by Oct. 15. And they’ll get $600 if 85% of an agency’s employees get the shot by Nov. 15. Meanwhile, Cuyahoga County Council on Tuesday formally approved $100 bonuses for county employees who get a COVID shot. Cleveland schools extend mask mandate(WCPN) -- The Cleveland Metropolitan School District is extending its mask mandate. Students, staff, and visitors, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear a mask inside all buildings through the end of October. The district's COVID-19 dashboard reports a total of 474 cases among students and staff so far this year. CEO Eric Gordon also noted every building is now staffed by a healthcare professional. The district had been operating under a five-week mask requirement that began when fall classes started on August 23. Cuyahoga judge McDonnell dies(WKSU) -- Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Nancy McDonnell has died at age 62. Court officials say she had been battling health issues for many years. She had spent nearly 25 years on the bench, including becoming the first female Administrative and Presiding Judge in 2006. Most recently, McDonnell presided over the county’s drug court. Ohio State sex abuse survivors plan appeals, defend motives(AP) — After a judge dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State over decades-old sexual abuse by a long-dead team doctor, plaintiffs say they'll keep pressing their cases against the university via appeals. Some say it's not just about seeking more compensation, or about money at all. They want other things, such as stronger reforms, greater accountability, and an outcome that doesn't block them from criticizing how the school handled the matter. The judge acknowledged that abuse occurred but concluded that the legal time limit for the claims had passed. Cases filed more recently involving dozens of plaintiffs are still pending. Goodyear further invests in self-driving technology(WKSU) -- Akron-based Goodyear is continuing to invest in self-driving technology. Goodyear’s venture capital fund, Goodyear Ventures, announced it took part in California-based Gatik’s recent funding round. Gatik is expanding its fleet of autonomous box trucks that provide delivery services for retailers such a Walmart. Its tires will be equipped with Goodyear’s intelligence technology to improve stopping distances and monitor tire pressure in real-time. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
2021-09-29	11:37:10+00:00	Unknown	upiasia	Senate hearing to examine Texas abortion law, Supreme Court 'shadow docket'	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/09/29/senate-supreme-court-shadow-docket-abortion/5521632911612/	"Sept. 29 (UPI) -- Senators held a hearing Wednesday to examine the U.S. Supreme Court's use of the so-called ""shadow docket"" in an inquiry that's focused on the court's decision not to block a controversial Texas abortion law that many legal scholars say is unconstitutional. Senate judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., accused the high court of making an ideologically driven ruling by making use of the shadow docket. ""The Supreme Court has now shown that it is willing to allow even facially unconstitutional laws to take effect when the laws align with certain ideological preferences,"" he said in prepared opening remarks. ""Constitutional rights for millions of Americans should not be stripped away in the dark of night, even at the Supreme Court ... It is already too late for many Texans whose rights have been suspended, and who have been forced to leave the state to seek reproductive health care the Constitution already guarantees them. But it is not too late for the rest of the country and the Court to change course."" Ranking member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, meanwhile, said the Supreme Court ""did something very ordinary"" with its ruling on the Texas abortion law. ""This campaign against the court and against individual justices has hurt the public,"" he said. ""This dishonest rhetoric doesn't help the American people understand the issues."" The high court drew the ire of many earlier this month when the majority of justices declined to intervene and block the ""heartbeat"" law, which bans abortions after as few as six weeks -- whenever a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The law also relies on the general public to enforce the law, allowing citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who seeks an abortion and anyone who aids them in that endeavor. The Texas law is one of several nationwide passed by Republican-held legislatures in recent years in a bid to challenge the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion in the United States. Abortion providers asked the Supreme Court to block the law in an emergency application, but the court voted 5-4 -- with an unsigned order -- to stay out of the issue. The unsigned order is part of what's known as the ""shadow docket,"" or a break from standard procedure under which the court, or a majority of justices, make rulings without explaining the reasoning behind them. The court also doesn't hear oral arguments and bases its decision solely on court filings. Critics of the court's use of the shadow docket say it gives the court too much power, in that it allows justices to set legal precedent without sufficient review -- or having to explain why they're ruling in a certain way. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said in the Texas case that the majority's unsigned order ""illustrates just how far the court's 'shadow-docket' decisions may depart from the usual principles of appellate process."" ""In all these ways, the majority's decision is emblematic of too much of this court's shadow docket decision-making -- which every day becomes more un-reasoned, inconsistent, and impossible to defend,"" she added. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined liberal justices on the bench in the Texas case, said in dissent that he would have blocked the law while on appeal, making an argument that appears to go to the heart of the shadow docket. ""We are at this point asked to resolve these novel questions [about the Texas abortion law] at least preliminarily -- in the first instance, in the course of two days, without the benefit of consideration by the District Court or Court of Appeals,"" he wrote. ""We are also asked to do so without ordinary merits briefing and without oral argument."" "
2021-09-29	11:35:24+00:00	https://www.gopusa.com/author/admin/	gopusa	Judge halts Arizona abortion ban in 11th-hour ruling	https://www.gopusa.com/judge-halts-arizona-abortion-ban-in-11th-hour-ruling/	United Press International | Sep 29, 2021 | News | 2 A federal judge granted abortion providers a preliminary injunction against a controversial Arizona abortion law hours before it was set to go into effect on Wednesday to criminalize abortions performed due to genetic issues of the fetus. U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes issued the injunction Tuesday in a ruling that threw out two provisions of the law that brings felony charges against doctors who knowingly abort a fetus with genetic issues, such as Down syndrome, for being unconstitutionally vague. The provisions in question are the Notification Provision, which requires the doctor to tell their patients that it is prohibited to abort a fetus due to a genetic abnormality, and the Criminal Liability Provision, which prohibits a provider from performing such an abortion if they know it is due to a genetic abnormality. Rayes wrote in his 30-page ruling that nowhere in the law does it outright prohibit abortions because of a fetal genetic abnormality, nor does it prohibit women from receiving pre-viability abortions because of such an issue. Instead, it prohibits a provider from performing such an abortion if the provider knows it is because of a fetal genetic abnormality. “At what point can a doctor be deemed to ‘know’ or ‘believe’ what is in the mind of a patient?” Rayes wrote. “This problem is exacerbated by the reality that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a complex one, and often is motivated by a variety of considerations, some of which are inextricably intertwined with the detection of a fetal genetic abnormality.” Rayes continued that the Notification Provision of the law will make it less likely for pregnant women seeking an abortion to say it is because of a fetal genetic issue. He also said that the provision requires providers to mislead their patients into believing that their constitutionally protected right to an abortion is unlawful. “The only reasonable inference that the court can draw is that the purpose and intended effect of the Notification Provision is to make it less likely that a woman, though desiring to terminate her pregnancy because of a fetal genetic abnormality, will successfully exercise her right to do so,” he said. Rayes, however, let stand a provision that abortion providers sought to have thrown out for classifying fetuses, embryos and fertilized eggs as people. Emily Nestler, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said they were “incredibly relieved” with the ruling. “People should not be interrogated about their reason for seeking an abortion,” Nestler said in a statement. “There are no right or wrong reasons.” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey had signed the law in April amid a movement within the Republican Party to limit abortions throughout the country. At the time he said there is “immeasurable value” in all life regardless of their genetics. “We will continue to prioritize protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives,” he said in a statement. The rule was challenged in August by Arizona abortion providers and abortion advocates. Cathi Herrod, president of the anti-abortion Center for Arizona Policy, said it was only the first review of the law in federal court with more to come. “We remain confident the law will be upheld and ruled enforceable in its entirety,” she said in a statement. “It’s a shame the abortion industry is standing in the way of protecting the most vulnerable from discrimination and life itself.” According to the the abortion advocacy Guttmacher Institute, there have been 561 abortion restrictions including 165 abortion bans introduced across 47 states for this year as of early June with 83 of those restrictions having been enacted. The organization said the number of restrictions enacted in that time is “unprecedented.” Copyright 2021 United Press International, Inc. (UPI).

2021-09-29	08:46:04+00:00	Unknown	Prensa latina	Across Latin America, protesters demand end to criminalization of abortion	https://www.laprensalatina.com/across-latin-america-protesters-demand-end-to-criminalization-of-abortion/	Bogotá, Sep 28 (EFE).- Latin America commemorated International Safe Abortion Day on Tuesday amid battles taking place in courts, across governmental bodies and on the streets. In the region, Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, Guyana and four Mexican territories have decriminalized abortion. However, in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Bolivia and Peru, abortion is illegal except in cases such as rape, fetal abnormalities incompatible with life or risk to the life of the mother. In Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras, the termination of pregnancy is totally illegal, and carries prison sentences for women who undergo the procedure and for those who carry it out. An unprecedented motion that decriminalizes abortion up to 14 weeks of gestation progressed Tuesday in Chile, where the three aforementioned exceptions have been admitted since 2017, but it still has a very long and complicated journey ahead. The Lower House ratified an amendment to the penal code that seeks to end punishments against women who carry out a voluntary termination of pregnancy until 14 weeks. However, this initiative, which the government of the conservative president Sebastián Piñera opposes, still lacks a process of concrete articulation in the legislature that, if passed, would make abortion not punishable, but would not guarantee it as a right. Mexico City and the states of Oaxaca, Hidalgo and Veracruz are the only Mexican territories where abortion is totally legal, but the women who demonstrated on Tuesday advocated for better sanitary and legal conditions across the country. Collectives demonstrated through the center of Mexico City and, although they had planned to go to the capital’s Zócalo, a group deviated from the original route to make a stop at the Angel of Independence, where they painted graffiti and tried to tear down the metal fences protecting it. During a march in San Salvador, protesters spoke out in favor of the implementation of public policies on sexual and reproductive health and, in turn, called on the legislature to amend the penal code to decriminalize abortion, at least on the three internationally recognized grounds. During a tour through the streets of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the most populated in Bolivia, protesters demanded free and safe abortions, or that at least the bodies involved respect the cases for interruption of pregnancy provided by law. Protesters asked that “public servants” stop putting up “obstacles” to performing abortions when they fall under those circumstances, and that workers who refuse to perform this procedure be punished. In Colombia, the Constitutional Court in 2006 decriminalized abortion in the three cases, but, according to the most recent report of the United Nations Population Fund published Tuesday, the court is debating whether Article 122 is unconstitutional in declaring the voluntary interruption of pregnancy a crime. The promoters of this change in Colombian legislation want abortion to be seen as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one. In Venezuela, organizations took advantage of global day of action for access to safe and legal abortion to demand that legislative and judicial powers decriminalize the interruption of pregnancy. “The criminalization of abortion violates the human rights of women, girls and adolescents to personal integrity, health, free development of the personality, the right not to be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, to live a life free of violence,” said Laura Cano, organizer of the so-called Green Route.
